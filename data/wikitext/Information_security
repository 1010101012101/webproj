administrative controls paramount importance
logical controls
called technical controls
software data monitor control access information computing systems
passwords
network host based firewalls

principle privilege requires individual
program system process granted access privileges perform task

information equal information requires degree protection
requires information assigned security classification
step information classification identify member senior management owner information classified
develop classification policy

factors influence classification information assigned include information organization
information information obsolete
laws regulatory requirements important considerations classifying information
business model information security enables security professionals examine security systems perspective
creating environment security managed holistically

access protected information restricted people authorized access information
computer programs
cases computers process information
authorized
requires mechanisms place control access protected information
sophistication access control mechanisms parity information protected sensitive valuable information stronger control mechanisms
foundation access control mechanisms built start identification authentication
identification assertion
person makes statement
john doe
making claim
claim true
john doe granted access protected information verify person claiming john doe john doe
authentication act verifying claim identity
john doe bank make withdrawal
tells bank teller john claim identity
bank teller asks
hands teller driver license
bank teller checks license make john doe printed compares photograph license person claiming john doe
photo match person
teller authenticated john doe claimed
types information authentication
strong authentication requires providing type authentication information
factor authentication
username common form identification computer systems today password common form authentication
usernames passwords served purpose modern world longer adequate

called authorization
authorization access information computing services begins administrative policies procedures
policies prescribe information computing services accessed
conditions
access control mechanisms configured enforce policies
computing systems equipped kinds access control offer choice access control mechanisms
access control mechanism system offers based approaches access control derived combination approaches
discretionary approach consolidates access control centralized administration
access information resources based individuals function
role
organization tasks individual perform
discretionary approach creator owner information resource ability control access resources
mandatory access control approach
access granted denied basing security classification assigned information resource
examples common access control mechanisms today include role based access control advanced database management file permissions provided unix windows operating systems
group policy objects provided windows network systems
kerberos

policies security controls enforceable upheld
effective policies ensure people held accountable actions
failed successful authentication attempts logged
