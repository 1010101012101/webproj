measuring time problematic

subtracting cost capital goods
utilities raw materials devoted meal
remainder represents factors production
primarily labor
types models household output determining monetary values inputs dinner
ingredients production meal compares market equivalents
criticism time valuation concerns choice monetary levels
unpaid work valued activity performed output produced
issue concerns differences quality market household products
feminist economists issue market system determine values variety reasons
lead conclusion market perfect substitutes market work
wage produced market services accurately reflect actual opportunity cost time spent household production
wages valuation methods industries wages depressed gender inequalities
accurately unpaid work
related argument market existing sex
gender divisions labor pay inequalities normal unproblematic
basic assumption underlying calculations
valuations produced serve reinforce gender inequalities challenge women subordination
criticisms leveled method valuation
opportunity cost method lost earnings worker toilet cleaned lawyer greater cleaned
means varies drastically
issues uniformity method multiple individuals
single person
uniform entire day days week
issue enjoyment activity deducted opportunity cost estimate
replacement cost method critics
types jobs substitutes
childcare activities calculated wages daycare workers child psychiatrists
relates problem depressed wages female dominated industries
jobs equivalent leads undervaluing unpaid work
