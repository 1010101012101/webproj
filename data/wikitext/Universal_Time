standard time
originally proposed sir sandford fleming
divided world twenty time zones
covering degrees longitude
clocks zone set time
differed hour neighboring zones
local time royal greenwich observatory greenwich

term universal time recommended international astronomical union precise term greenwich time
gmt refer astronomical day starting noon civil day starting midnight
term greenwich time persists common usage day reference civil timekeeping
time measured based rotation earth observing celestial bodies crossing meridian day
astronomers found accurate establish time observing stars crossed meridian observing position sun sky
nowadays
relation international atomic time

final arbiter broadcast standards international telecommunication union itu
rotation earth irregular
gradually slowing due tidal acceleration
length determined observations moon
factors solar day
average
slightly longer nominal seconds
traditional number seconds day
slightly irregular rate
astronomers introduced ephemeris time
replaced terrestrial time
universal time synchronous night day
precise atomic frequency standards drift
produce correction
called leap
atomic time
order obtain broadcast form civil time carries atomic frequency
civil broadcast standards time frequency follow tai closely
occasionally change discontinuously
leap
order prevent drifting solar time
barycentric dynamical time
tdb
form atomic time
construction ephemerides planets solar system objects
main reasons
ephemerides tied optical radar observations planetary motion
tdb time scale fitted newton laws motion
corrections general relativity
time scales based earth rotation uniform suitable predicting motion bodies solar system
