supercontinent existed late paleozoic early mesozoic eras
forming million years ago beginning rift million years ago
component continents separated current configurations
single global ocean surrounded pangaea named panthalassa
pangaea derived ancient greek pan
meaning
entire
gaia
meaning
earth
coined symposium discussing alfred wegener theory continental drift
book origin continents oceans

published
postulated continents time formed single supercontinent called
urkontinent
breaking drifting present locations

fossil evidence pangaea includes presence similar identical species continents great distances

freshwater reptile mesosaurus found localized regions coasts brazil west africa
additional evidence pangaea found geology adjacent continents
including matching geological trends eastern coast south america western coast africa
polar ice cap carboniferous period covered southern end pangaea
glacial deposits
specifically till
age structure found separate continents continent pangaea
paleomagnetic study apparent polar wandering paths support theory super continent
geologists determine movement continental plates examining orientation magnetic minerals rocks
rocks formed
magnetic properties earth direction poles lie relative rock
magnetic poles drift rotational pole period thousand years
measurements numerous lavas spanning thousand years averaged give apparent polar position
samples sedimentary rock intrusive igneous rock magnetic orientations typically average
secular variations
orientation magnetic north magnetic fields formed instant
case cooling lava
magnetic differences sample groups age varies millions years due combination true polar wander drifting continents
true polar wander component identical samples

major phases break pangaea
phase began early middle jurassic
pangaea began rift tethys ocean east pacific west
ultimately giving rise supercontinents laurasia gondwana
rifting place north america africa produced multiple failed rifts
rift resulted ocean
north atlantic ocean
atlantic ocean open uniformly
rifting began north central atlantic
south atlantic open cretaceous
laurasia started rotate clockwise moved northward north america north
eurasia south
clockwise motion laurasia led closing tethys ocean
side africa
rifts forming adjacent margins east africa
antarctica madagascar lead formation southwestern indian ocean open cretaceous
major phase break pangaea began early cretaceous
minor supercontinent gondwana separated multiple continents

continent cimmeria
mentioned
formation pangaea
collided eurasia
subduction zone forming
cimmeria collided
subduction zone called tethyan trench
trench subducted called tethyan mid ocean ridge
ridge responsible tethys ocean expansion
caused africa
india australia move northward
early cretaceous
atlantica
today south america africa
finally separated eastern gondwana
antarctica
india australia
causing opening
south indian ocean
middle cretaceous
gondwana fragmented open south atlantic ocean south america started move westward africa
south atlantic develop uniformly
rifted south north
time
madagascar india began separate antarctica moved northward
opening indian ocean
madagascar india separated late cretaceous
india continued move northward eurasia centimeters
year
plate tectonic record
closing tethys ocean
madagascar stopped locked african plate
zealand
caledonia rest zealandia began separate australia
moving eastward pacific opening coral sea tasman sea
major final phase break pangaea occurred early cenozoic
paleocene oligocene
laurasia split north america
greenland
called laurentia
broke free eurasia
opening norwegian sea
atlantic indian oceans continued expand
closing tethys ocean
australia split antarctica moved rapidly northward
india million years
collision eastern asia
australia india moving northeast
year
antarctica south pole formation pangaea
india started collide asia beginning
forming himalayan orogeny
finally closing tethys seaway
collision continues today
african plate started change directions
west northwest europe
south america began move northward direction
separating antarctica allowing complete oceanic circulation antarctica time
decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations caused rapid cooling antarctica allowed glaciers form
eventually coalesced kilometers thick ice sheets today
major events place cenozoic
including opening gulf california
uplift alps
opening sea japan
break pangaea continues today red sea rift east african rift
