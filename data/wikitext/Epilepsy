Epilepsy

epilepsy
epilepsy common diverse set chronic neurological disorders characterized seizures
definitions epilepsy require seizures recurrent unprovoked
require single seizure combined brain alterations increase chance future seizures
cases identified
factors include brain trauma
strokes
brain cancer
drug alcohol misuse
epileptic seizures result abnormal
excessive hypersynchronous neuronal activity brain
million people worldwide epilepsy
epilepsy occurs developing countries
epilepsy common people age
onset cases occurs frequently infants elderly
consequence brain surgery
epileptic seizures occur recovering patients
epilepsy controlled

medication
people epilepsy seizure control medications
surgery considered difficult cases
epilepsy syndromes lifelong forms confined stages childhood
epilepsy understood single disorder
syndromic vastly divergent symptoms
involving episodic abnormal electrical activity brain numerous seizures
epilepsy characterized long term risk recurrent seizures
seizures present number ways
diagnosis epilepsy requires seizures occur spontaneously
epilepsy syndromes require precipitants triggers seizures occur
termed reflex epilepsy
patients primary reading epilepsy seizures triggered reading
photosensitive epilepsy limited seizures triggered flashing lights
precipitants trigger epileptic seizure patients susceptible spontaneous seizures
children childhood absence epilepsy susceptible hyperventilation
fact
flashing lights hyperventilation activating procedures clinical eeg trigger seizures aid diagnosis

mutations genes linked types epilepsy
genes code protein units voltage gated ligand gated ion channels forms generalized epilepsy infantile seizure syndromes
speculated mechanism forms inherited epilepsy mutations genes code sodium channel proteins
defective sodium channels stay open long
making neuron hyper excitable
glutamate
excitatory neurotransmitter
released neurons large amounts
binding nearby glutamatergic neurons triggers excessive calcium
release post synaptic cells
excessive calcium release neurotoxic affected cell
hippocampus
large volume glutamatergic neurons
nmda receptors
permeable entry binding glutamate glycine
vulnerable epileptic seizure
subsequent spread excitation
neuronal death
mechanism involves mutations leading ineffective gaba

process called epileptogenesis
interesting finding animals repeated low level electrical stimulation brain sites lead permanent increases seizure susceptibility

important note
kindled
animals experience spontaneous seizures
chemical stimulation induce seizures
repeated exposures pesticides shown induce seizures humans animals
mechanism proposed called excitotoxicity
