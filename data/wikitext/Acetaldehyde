acetaldehyde
systematically ethanal
organic chemical compound formula cho
abbreviated chemists mecho
methyl
important aldehydes
occurring widely nature produced large scale industrially
acetaldehyde occurs naturally coffee
bread
ripe fruit
produced plants part normal metabolism
produced oxidation ethylene popularly believed hangovers alcohol consumption
pathways exposure include air
water
land groundwater drink smoke
global production million tonnes
main production method oxidation ethylene wacker process
alternatively
hydration acetylene
catalyzed mercury salts ethenol
tautomerizes acetaldehyde
industrial route dominant prior wacker process smaller capacities required prepared dehydrogenation partial oxidation combined dehydrogenation
acetaldehyde forms hydrogenation
method commercially
carbonyl compounds
acetaldehyde tautomerizes give enol
enol acetaldehyde vinyl alcohol
iupac
ethenol
equilibrium constant room temperature
amount enol sample acetaldehyde small
small size availability anhydrous monomer
unlike formaldehyde
common electrophile organic synthesis
respect condensation reactions
acetaldehyde prochiral
source
synthon aldol related condensation reactions
grignard reagents organolithium compounds react mecho give hydroxyethyl derivatives
spectacular condensation reactions
equivalents formaldehyde add mecho give pentaerythritol
strecker reaction
acetaldehyde condenses cyanide ammonia give
hydrolysis
amino acid alanine
acetaldehyde condense amines yield imines
condensation cyclohexylamine give ethylidenecyclohexylamine
imines direct subsequent reactions aldol condensation
important building block synthesis heterocyclic compounds
remarkable conversion treatment ammonia ethyl methylpyridine
aldehyde
molecules acetaldehyde condense form
cyclic trimer single bonds
condensation molecules acetaldehyde give cyclic molecule called metaldehyde
acetaldehyde forms stable acetal reaction ethanol conditions favor dehydration
