theories explanatory power make predictions
pair theories called indistinguishable
choice reduces convenience philosophical preference
form theories studied formally mathematical logic
model theory
theories studied mathematics
expressed formal language statements closed application procedures called rules inference
special case
axiomatic theory
consists axioms
axiom schemata
rules inference
theorem statement derived axioms application rules inference
theories applications abstractions observed phenomena resulting theorems provide solutions real world problems
obvious examples include arithmetic
abstracting concepts number
geometry
concepts space
probability
concepts randomness likelihood
incompleteness theorem shows consistent
recursively enumerable theory
theorems form recursively enumerable set
concept natural numbers expressed
include true statements
result
domains knowledge formalized
accurately completely
mathematical theories
formalizing accurately completely means true true derivable mathematical system
limitation
precludes construction mathematical theories formalize large bodies scientific knowledge
theory underdetermined
called indeterminacy data theory
evidence cited support theory
rival theory inconsistent consistent evidence
underdetermination epistemological issue relation evidence conclusions
theory explaining predicting phenomena older theory
explanatory power
justified believing newer theory describes reality correctly
called intertheoretic reduction terms theory reduced terms
instance
historical understanding
sound
light
heat
today reduced
wave compressions rarefactions
electromagnetic waves
molecular kinetic energy
terms identified called intertheoretic identities
theory parallel
conclude describing reality
completely
cases theory terms reduce terms older
replace misrepresentation called intertheoretic elimination
instance
obsolete scientific theory put forward understanding heat transfer terms movement caloric fluid eliminated theory heat energy replaced
theory phlogiston substance released burning rusting material eliminated understanding reactivity oxygen
theories distinct theorems
theorems derived deductively objections formal system rules
end step testing applying theory concrete situation
theorems true sense conclusions theorem logical consequences objections
theories abstract conceptual
end considered true
supported challenged observations world
rigorously tentative
meaning proposed true expected satisfy careful examination account possibility faulty inference incorrect observation
theories incorrect
meaning explicit set observations contradicts fundamental objection application theory
theories corrected conform observations
restricting class phenomena theory applies changing assertions made
restriction classical mechanics phenomena involving macroscopic lengthscales particle speeds lower speed light
hypothesis reaches point considered theory answer found derive assertions analytically applied empirically
