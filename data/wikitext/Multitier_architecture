widespread multi tier architecture tier architecture
tier application architecture model developers create flexible reusable applications
segregating application tiers
developers acquire option modifying adding specific layer
reworking entire application
tier architectures typically comprise presentation tier
business data access tier
data tier
concepts layer tier interchangeably
fairly common point view difference
view holds layer logical structuring mechanism elements make software solution
tier physical structuring mechanism system infrastructure
growing concernsby
recent years organizations facing excessive number layers multi layered architecture
concerns stem sprawling application architectures designed managed
development teams create growing number
