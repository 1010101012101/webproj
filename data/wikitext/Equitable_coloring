motivation equitable coloring suggested meyer
concerns scheduling problems
application
vertices graph represent collection tasks performed
edge connects tasks performed time
coloring graph represents partition tasks subsets performed simultaneously
number colors coloring corresponds number time steps required perform entire task
due load balancing considerations
desirable perform equal equal numbers tasks time step
balancing equitable coloring achieves
mentions specific application type scheduling problem
