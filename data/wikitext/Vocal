disorders affect human voice
include speech impediments
growths lesions vocal folds
talking improperly long periods time vocal loading
stress inflicted speech organs
vocal injury
ent specialist
treatment prevention injuries good vocal production
voice therapy generally delivered speech language pathologist
vocal nodules caused time repeated abuse vocal cords results soft
swollen spots vocal cord
spots develop harder
callous growths called nodules
longer abuse occurs larger stiffer nodules
polyps larger nodules called names
polypoid degeneration reinke edema
polyps caused single occurrence require surgical removal
irritation removal lead nodules additional irritation persists
speech language therapy teaches patient eliminate irritations permanently habit vocal hygiene
hoarseness breathiness lasts weeks common symptom underlying voice disorder nodes polyps investigated medically
