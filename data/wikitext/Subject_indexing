Subject indexing

subject indexing
subject indexing act describing classifying document index terms symbols order document
summarize content increase findability
words
identifying describing subject documents
indexes constructed
separately
distinct levels
terms document book
objects collection library
documents
books articles
field knowledge
subject indexing information retrieval create bibliographic databases retrieve documents subject
examples academic indexing services zentralblatt math
chemical abstracts pubmed
index terms assigned experts author keywords common
process indexing begins analysis subject document
indexer identify terms appropriately identify subject extracting words directly document assigning words controlled vocabulary
terms index presented systematic order
indexers decide terms include specific terms
depth indexing
step indexing decide subject matter document
manual indexing
indexer subject matter terms answer set questions
document deal specific product
condition phenomenon
analysis influenced knowledge experience indexer
indexers analyse content differently index terms
impact success retrieval
automatic indexing set processes analysing frequencies word patterns comparing results documents order assign subject categories
requires understanding material indexed leads uniform indexing expense true meaning interpreted
computer program understand meaning statements fail assign relevant terms assign incorrectly
human indexers focus attention parts document title
abstract
summary conclusions
analysing full text depth costly time consuming automated system takes time limit entire document analysed
option directed parts document
stage indexing involves translation subject analysis set index terms
involve extracting document assigning controlled vocabulary
ability conduct full text search widely
people rely expertise conducting information searches full text search popular
subject indexing experts
professional indexers
catalogers
librarians
remains crucial information organization retrieval
experts understand controlled vocabularies find information located full text search
cost expert analysis create subject indexing easily compared cost hardware
software labor manufacture comparable set full text
fully searchable materials
web applications user annotate documents
social tagging gained popularity web
application indexing
book index
remains unchanged information revolution
extraction indexing involves taking words directly document
natural language lends automated techniques word frequencies calculated frequency pre determined threshold index terms
stop list common words
referred stop words excluded index terms
automated extraction indexing lead loss meaning terms indexing single words opposed phrases
extract commonly occurring phrases
difficult key concepts inconsistently worded phrases
automated extraction indexing problem stop list remove common words
frequent words allowing discrimination documents
term glucose occur frequently document related diabetes
term return documents database
post ordinated indexing terms combined time searching reduce effect onus searcher link terms opposed information professional
addition terms occur infrequently highly significant drug mentioned infrequently novelty subject makes reference significant
method allowing rarer terms included common words excluded automated techniques relative frequency approach frequency word document compared frequency database
term occurs document expected based rest database index term
terms occur equally frequently excluded
problem automated extraction recognise concept discussed identified text indexable keyword
alternative assignment indexing index terms controlled vocabulary
advantage controlling synonyms preferred term indexed synonyms related terms direct user preferred term
means user find articles specific term author saves user check synonyms
removes confusion caused homographs inclusion qualifying term
advantage linking related terms linked hierarchy association
index entry oral medication list oral medications related terms level hierarchy link broader terms treatment
assignment indexing manual indexing improve inter indexer consistency indexers controlled set terms choose
controlled vocabularies completely remove inconsistencies indexers interpret subject differently
final phase indexing present entries systematic order
involve linking entries
pre coordinated index indexer determines order terms linked entry user formulate search
post coordinated index
entries presented singly user link entries searches
commonly carried computer software
post coordination results loss precision comparison pre coordination
indexers make decisions entries included entries index incorporate
depth indexing describes thoroughness indexing process reference exhaustivity specificity
exhaustive index lists index terms
greater exhaustivity higher recall
likelihood relevant articles retrieved
occurs expense precision
means user retrieve larger number irrelevant documents documents deal subject depth
manual system greater level exhaustivity brings greater cost man hours required
additional time automated system significant
end scale
selective index important aspects covered
recall reduced selective index indexer include terms
highly relevant article overlooked
indexers strive balance document
implications time expense
specificity describes closely index terms match topics represent index specific indexer parallel descriptors concept document reflects concepts precisely
