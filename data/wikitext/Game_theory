formally
study mathematical models conflict cooperation intelligent rational decision makers
alternative term suggested
descriptive discipline

subject addressed sum games
person gains equal net losses participant
today
game theory applies wide range class relations
developed umbrella term logical side science
include human humans
computers
classic include sense balance numerous games
person found developed tactic successfully results
approach
modern game theory began idea existence mixed strategy equilibria person sum games proof john von neumann
von neumann original proof brouwer fixed point theorem continuous mappings compact convex sets
standard method game theory mathematical economics
paper book theory games economic behavior
oskar morgenstern
considered cooperative games players
edition book provided axiomatic theory expected utility
allowed mathematical statisticians economists treat decision making uncertainty
theory developed extensively scholars
game theory explicitly applied biology

evolutionary game theory explain seemingly incongruous phenomena nature
phenomenon biological altruism
situation organism appears act benefits organisms detrimental
distinct traditional notions altruism actions conscious
evolutionary adaptations increase fitness
examples found species ranging vampire bats regurgitate blood obtained night hunting give group members failed feed
worker bees care queen bee entire lives mate
vervet monkeys warn group members predator approach
endangers individual chance survival
actions increase fitness group

evolutionary game theory explains altruism idea kin selection
altruists discriminate individuals favor relatives
hamilton rule explains evolutionary reasoning selection equation cost
altruist benefit
