electron trap
free electron attracted trapped
flux ionizing cosmic radiation natural electrons atoms crystal lattice conduction band move freely
excited electrons recombine lattice ions
trapped
storing part energy radiation form trapped electric charge

long term traps determine age materials
irradiated crystalline material heated exposed strong light
trapped electrons sufficient energy escape
process recombining lattice ion
