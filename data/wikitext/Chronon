time part theory proposes time continuous
time continuous quantity standard quantum mechanics general relativity
physicists suggested discrete model time work
combination quantum mechanics general relativity produce theory quantum gravity
term introduced sense robert
henry margenau suggested chronon time light travel classical radius electron
quantum theory time quantum variable discrete spectrum
consistent special relativity
proposed chen ning yang
model introduced piero caldirola
caldirola model
chronon corresponds

nature moving particle considered chronon depends particle charge mass
caldirola claims chronon important implications quantum mechanics
clear answer question free falling charged particle emit radiation
model supposedly avoids difficulties met dirac approaches problem
natural explication quantum decoherence
