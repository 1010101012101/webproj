life cycle genus cyathus
haploid diploid stages
typical taxa basidiomycetes reproduce asexually
vegetative spores
sexually
meiosis
wood decay fungi
life cycle considered functionally phases
vegetative stage spread mycelia
reproductive stage establishment spore producing structures
fruit bodies
vegetative stage encompasses phases life cycle involved germination
spread
survival mycelium
spores germinate suitable conditions moisture temperature
grow branching filaments called hyphae
pushing roots rotting wood
hyphae homokaryotic
single nucleus compartment
increase length adding cell wall material growing tip
tips expand spread produce growing points
network called mycelium develops
mycelial growth occurs mitosis synthesis hyphal biomass
homokaryotic hyphae mating compatibility groups fuse
form dikaryotic mycelia process called plasmogamy
prerequisites mycelial survival colonization substrate
rotting wood
include suitable humidity nutrient availability
majority cyathus species saprobic
mycelial growth rotting wood made secretion enzymes break complex polysaccharides
cellulose lignin
simple sugars nutrients
period time environmental conditions
dikaryotic mycelia enter reproductive stage life cycle
fruit body formation influenced external factors season
affects temperature air humidity
nutrients light
fruit bodies develop produce peridioles basidia basidiospores made
young basidia pair haploid sexually compatible nuclei fuse
resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis produce basidiospores
single haploid nucleus
dikaryotic mycelia fruit bodies produced long lasting
continue produce successive generations fruit bodies long environmental conditions favorable
