historically
time standards based earth rotational period
late century century assumed earth daily rotational rate constant
astronomical observations kinds
including eclipse records
studied century
raised suspicions rate earth rotates gradually slowing shows small scale irregularities
confirmed early twentieth century
time standards based earth rotation replaced
initially supplemented
astronomical onwards ephemeris time standard based earth orbital period practice motion moon
invention caesium atomic clock led replacement older purely astronomical time standards
practical purposes
newer time standards based wholly partly atomic time
types day basic time interval time scales

apparent solar day varies dozen seconds hours
variation accumulates weeks
differences large minutes apparent solar time solar time
