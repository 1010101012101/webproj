Language development

language development
language development process starting early human life
infants start language
months age
babies discriminate speech sounds engage babbling
research shown earliest learning begins utero fetus starts recognize sounds speech patterns mother voice
productive language considered begin stage preverbal communication infants gestures vocalizations make intents
general principle development
forms functions
children learn words express communicative functions expressed preverbal means
language development thought proceed ordinary processes learning children acquire forms
meanings words utterances linguistic input
method develop language skills universal
major debate rules syntax acquired
major approaches syntactic development
empiricist account children learn syntactic rules linguistic input
nativist approach principles syntax innate transmitted human genome
nativist theory
proposed noam chomsky
argues language unique human accomplishment
chomsky children called lad
innate language acquisition device children produce consistent sentences vocabulary learned
claim based view children hear linguistic input insufficient explain learn language
view dominated linguistic theory fifty years remains highly influential
witnessed number articles journals
books
empiricist theory suggests
contra chomsky
information linguistic input children receive
assume innate language acquisition device
researchers tradition employ methodology involving construction computational models learn aspects language
simulate type linguistic output produced children
statistical learning theories suggested saffran
connectionist models chunking theories
researchers embrace interactionist perspective
consisting social interactionist theories language development
approaches
children learn language interactive communicative context
learning language forms meaningful moves communication
theories focus caregiver attitudes attentiveness children order promote productive language habits
older empiricist theory
behaviorist theory proposed
skinner suggested language learned operant conditioning
imitation stimuli reinforcement correct responses
perspective widely accepted time
accounts
experiencing resurgence
empiricist theory accounts today behaviorist models
relevant theories language development include piaget theory cognitive development
considers development language continuation general cognitive development vygotsky social theories attribute development language individual social interactions growth
evolutionary biologists skeptical claim syntactic knowledge transmitted human genome
researchers claim ability acquire complicated system unique human species
biologists tend ability learn spoken language developed evolutionary process foundation language passed genetically
ability speak understand human language requires specific vocal apparatus nervous system capabilities
hotly debated issue biological contribution includes capacities specific language acquisition
referred universal grammar
fifty years
linguist noam chomsky argued hypothesis children innate
language specific abilities facilitate constrain language learning
proposed humans biologically prewired learn language time
arguing children born language acquisition device
lad
developed minimalist program
latest version theory syntactic structure
chomsky reduced elements universal grammar opinion prewired humans principle recursion
voiding nativist endeavor
researchers grammar learned innate
hypothesized language learning results general cognitive abilities interaction learners human interactants
recently suggested slow development prefrontal cortex humans reason humans learn language

female advantage obvious
females age range showed spontaneous speech production males finding due mothers speaking daughters sons

language spoken higher pitch normal simple words sentences
importance role developing language debated
linguists aid capturing infant attention maintaining communication
children begin communicate adults
motherese speech child ability discern patterns language experiment language
research
concluded children exposed extensive vocabulary complex grammatical structures quickly develop language accurate syntax children raised environments complex grammar exposed
motherese
mother talks child responds back child
babble child made short sentence
adult prompting child continue communicating child develop language sooner children raised environments communication fostered
motherese speech catch child attention situations words objects expressed child form speech child recognize speech cues information provided
data shows children raised highly verbal families higher language scores children raised low verbal families
continuously hearing complicated sentences language development increases child ability understand sentences complicated sentences develop
studies shown students enrolled high language classrooms times growth complex sentences usage students classrooms teachers frequently complex sentences

main components language
component developmental periods
shortly birth year
baby starts make speech sounds
months
baby engage cooing
consists vowel sounds
months
cooing turns babbling repetitive consonant vowel combinations
babies understand
years
babies recognize correct pronunciation familiar words
babies phonological strategies simplify word pronunciation
strategies include repeating consonant vowel multisyllable word
idi
deleting unstressed syllables multisyllable word
banana
years
phonological awareness continues improve pronunciation
years
children master syllable stress patterns helps distinguish slight differences similar words
birth year
comprehension
language understand
develops production
language
month lag
babies innate preference listen mother voice
babies recognize familiar words preverbal gestures
years
vocabulary grows hundred words
vocabulary spurt months
includes fast mapping
fast mapping babies ability learn lot things quickly
majority babies vocabulary consists object words
nouns
action words
verbs
years
children difficulty words correctly
children experience problems underextensions
taking general word applying specifically
blankie
overextensions
taking specific word applying generally
car van
children coin words fill words learned
cooker chef child chef
children understand metaphors
years
children understand meanings words based definitions
multiple meanings words words precisely metaphors puns
fast mapping continues
years
children start telegraphic speech
word combinations

years
children engage simple sentences
word sentences
simple sentences follow adult rules refined gradually
grammatical morphemes added simple sentences start emerge
years
children continue add grammatical morphemes gradually produce complex grammatical structures
years
children refine complex grammatical structures passive voice
