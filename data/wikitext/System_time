System time

system time
computer science computer programming
system time represents computer system notion passing time
sense
time includes passing days calendar
system time measured system clock
typically implemented simple count number ticks transpired arbitrary starting date
called epoch
unix posix compliant systems encode system time
unix time
number seconds elapsed start unix epoch january
exceptions leap seconds
systems implement bit bit versions windows api
windows windows
provide system time systemtime
represented year
month
day
hour
minute
milliseconds
filetime
represented count number nanosecond ticks january
reckoned proleptic gregorian calendar
returns current time nearest millisecondcitation needed
system time converted calendar time
form suitable human comprehension
unix system time seconds beginning epoch translates calendar time september
library subroutines handle conversions deal adjustments timezones
daylight saving time

leap seconds
user locale settings
library routines generally provided convert calendar times system times
closely related system time process time
count total cpu time consumed executing process
split user system cpu time
representing time spent executing user code system kernel code
process times tally cpu instructions clock cycles generally direct correlation wall time
file systems track times files created
