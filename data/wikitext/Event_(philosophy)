Event (philosophy)

event
philosophy
events objects time instantiations properties objects
definite definition reached
multiple theories exist events
jaegwon kim theorized events structured
composed things
events defined operation
unique event defined principles
existence condition states
exists object exemplifies adic time
means unique event exists met
identity condition states
kim define events conditions
problems exist theory

basic parameters terms laws theory formulated
view
give basic generic events
usual logical
mathematical
types operations yield complex
defined generic events
commonly recognize properties motion
colors
temperatures
weights
pushing
breaking
generic events states
view background common sense explanatory predictive scheme world
highly pick generic events completely priori
kim
major debate essentiality constitutive object
major questions involved
event occurs
occurred manner person
occur manner occurred time
kim holds true conditions
person time
lead separate event
natural assume opposite
davidson lemmon proposed theory events major conditions
causal criterion spatiotemporal criterion
causal criterion defines event events effect
spatiotemporal criterion defines event events occur space time
davidson provided scenario
metal ball warmer minute
minute rotates degrees
event
argue warming ball rotation possibly temporally separated separate events
david lewis theorized events spatiotemporal regions properties
membership class
defines event event class spatiotemporal regions
thisworldly
assuming occurs actual world
otherworldly
problem definition tells event
define unique event
theory entails modal realism
assumes worlds exist
worlds defined sets objects exist part set
theory controversial
philosophers attempted remove worlds
reduce entities
hold world exist world exists
worlds possibilities
theory composed key points
firstly
duplication principle
states separate events member member
vice versa
exist regions subsets worlds thirdly
events structured essential time
event
alain badiou writes event multiple basically make sense rules
situation

meaning multiple belongs multiple terms drawn defined reference set theory

definition event violates prohibition belonging
