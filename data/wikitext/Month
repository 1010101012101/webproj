month
month unit time

invented mesopotamia
natural period related motion moon
month moon cognates
traditional concept arose cycle moon phases
months
lunations
synodic months approximately
days
excavated tally sticks

recognized babylonian lunar astronomy
period moon orbit defined respect celestial sphere
fixed stars
nowadays international celestial reference frame

written raconitic month
called nodical month
orbit moon lies plane tilted respect plane ecliptic
inclination degrees
line intersection planes defines points celestial sphere
ascending node
moon path crosses ecliptic moon moves northern hemisphere
descending node moon path crosses ecliptic moon moves southern hemisphere
draconic nodical month average interval successive transits moon ascending node
sun gravitational pull moon
moon orbit gradually rotates westward axis
means nodes gradually rotate earth
result

average period moon revolution respect line joining sun earth
synodic month period moon phases
moon appearance depends position moon respect sun earth
moon orbiting earth
earth progressing orbit sun
completing sidereal month moon move reach position angular distance sun
longer period called synodic month
