Dominance hierarchy

dominance hierarchy
dominance hierarchy arises members social group interact
aggressively
create ranking system
social living groups
members compete access limited resources mating opportunities
fight time meet
relative relationships formed members sex
repetitive interactions lead creation social order subject change time dominant animal challenged subordinate
manifestation intrasexual conflict observed systems
social order linear despotic
linear ranking system
referred pecking order
member gender recognized dominant submissive relative
creating linear distribution rank
groups spotted hyenas brown hyenas demonstrate linear dominance
despotic system
member considered dominant members living group equally submissive
examples despotic social systems found meerkats
wolves
male gorillas
african wild dogs

high ranking males mate high ranking females
assuming high rank correlated higher fitness fighting ability
trait conferred offspring

subordinate animals engage number behaviors order outweigh aforementioned costs
subordinate offset costs leaving group dispersal incurs high mortality rates

suppression reduces sexual virility behavior redirects dominant behavior helping queen offspring
mechanisms accomplished debated
research suggests needed pheromones secreted queen direct suppression vital reproductive hormones functions current evidence suggests secretion pheromones act suppress reproductive function extremely high levels circulating testosterone

evidence suggests glucocorticoids
signaling molecules
commonly stress hormones
produced adrenal glands stimulate fight flight response implicated establishment dominance hierarchies
field research shown higher ranking individuals tend higher levels circulating glucocorticoids compared subdominant individuals hierarchy
stark opposition original suggestion stating subdominant stressful needed hierarchy
core hypotheses attempt explain unusual findings
suggests higher ranking individuals exert energy higher levels glucocorticoids readily mobilize glycogen stores energy
hypothesis supported research showing food availability low
cortisol levels tended increase dominant male allowing increased glycogen metabolism subsequent energy production
hypothesis suggests elevated stress hormones result social factors hierarchy hierarchy transition
proponents theory assert hierarchy unstable
aggressive interaction confrontations increase hierarchy
result
dominant individual ends fighting hierarchy stable consequence increased fighting
glucocorticoids elevated period
field studies olive baboons kenyaseem support hypothesis observed dominant individuals tended lower cortisol levels stable hierarchy subdominant individuals
hierarchy shifted unstable
dominant individual showed higher levels cortisol compared subdominant individuals
quick point
extremely unusual dominant individuals rarely low levels glucocorticoids hierarchy state
nonetheless
appears dominant beneficial previously thought chronic levels glucocorticoids variety adverse health effects including immunosuppression
