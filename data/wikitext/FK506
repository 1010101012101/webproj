detail
tacrolimus reduces peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity binding immunophilin
binding protein
creating complex
complex interacts inhibits calcineurin inhibiting lymphocyte signal transduction transcription
activity similar ciclosporin
studies shown incidence acute rejection reduced tacrolimus ciclosporin
short term immunosuppression patient graft survival found similar drugs
tacrolimus results favorable lipid profile
important long term implications prognostic influence rejection graft survival
similar immunosuppressive properties ciclosporin
