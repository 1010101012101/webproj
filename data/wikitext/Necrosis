dead
death
stage dying
act killing
form cell injury results premature death cells living tissue
necrosis caused factors external cell tissue
infection
toxins
trauma result unregulated digestion cell components
contrast
apoptosis naturally occurring programmed targeted cellular death
apoptosis beneficial effects organism
necrosis detrimental fatal
cells die due necrosis follow apoptotic signal transduction pathway receptors activated result loss cell membrane integrity uncontrolled release products cell death intracellular space
initiates inflammatory response surrounding tissue
nearby phagocytes prevented locating engulfing dead cells
result build dead tissue cell debris
site cell death
classic gangrene
reason
remove necrotic tissue surgically
process debridement
necrosis sum cell localized cellular death process autolysis
structural signs irreversible cell injury progression necrosis include
dense clumping progressive disruption genetic material
disruption membranes cells organelles
distinctive morphological patterns necrosis
coagulative necrosis characterized formation gelatinous
gel
substance dead tissues architecture tissue maintained
observed light microscopy
coagulation occurs result protein denaturation
causing albumin protein form firm opaque state
pattern necrosis typically hypoxic
low oxygen
environments
infarction
coagulative necrosis occurs primarily tissues kidney
heart adrenal glands
severe ischemia commonly necrosis form
liquefactive necrosis
colliquative necrosis
contrast coagulative necrosis
characterized digestion dead cells form viscous liquid mass
typical bacterial
fungal
infections ability stimulate inflammatory response
necrotic liquid mass frequently creamy yellow due presence dead leukocytes commonly pus
hypoxic infarcts brain presents type necrosis
brain connective tissue high amounts digestive enzymes lipids
cells readily digested enzymes
caseous necrosis considered combination coagulative liquefactive necroses
typically caused mycobacteria
tuberculosis
fungi foreign substances
necrotic tissue appears white friable
clumped cheese
dead cells disintegrate completely digested
leaving granular particles
microscopic examination shows amorphous granular debris enclosed distinctive inflammatory border
granuloma characteristic
fat necrosis specialized necrosis fat tissue
resulting action activated lipases fatty tissues pancreas
pancreas leads acute pancreatitis
condition pancreatic enzymes leak peritoneal cavity
liquefy membrane splitting triglyceride esters fatty acids fat saponification
calcium
magnesium sodium bind lesions produce chalky white substance
calcium deposits microscopically distinctive large visible radiographic examinations
naked eye
calcium deposits gritty white flecks
fibrinoid necrosis special form necrosis caused immune mediated vascular damage
marked complexes antigen antibodies
referred deposited arterial walls fibrin
specific forms necrosis gangrene
term clinical practices limbs suffered severe hypoxia
gummatous necrosis
due spirochaetal infections
haemorrhagic necrosis
due blockage venous drainage organ tissue
spider bites lead necrosis
united states

spiders genus chilean recluse south america
similarly shown necrosis countries
yellow sac spiders hobo spider claimed possess necrotic venom
claims challenged
blind mole rats
genus spalax
process necrosis replaces role systematic apoptosis organisms
low oxygen conditions
common blind mole burrows
cells undergo apoptosis
adaptation higher tendency cell death
blind mole rats evolved mutation tumor suppressor protein
humans
prevent cells undergoing apoptosis
human cancer patients similar mutations
blind mole rats thought susceptible cancer cells undergo apoptosis
specific amount time
days study conducted university rochester
cells blind mole rats release interferon beta
immune system counter viruses
response proliferation cells caused suppression apoptosis
case
interferon beta triggers cells undergo necrosis
mechanism kills cancer cells blind mole rats
tumor suppression mechanisms
blind mole rats spalacids resistant cancer
necrosis occur due external internal factors
external factors involve mechanical trauma
physical damage body
cellular breakdown
damage blood vessels
disrupt blood supply area
ischemia
thermal effects
extremely high low temperature
result necrosis due disruption cells
frostbite
crystals form
increasing pressure remaining tissue fluid causing cells burst
extreme conditions tissues cells die unregulated process destruction membranes cytosol
internal factors causing necrosis include trophoneurotic disorders
injury paralysis nerve cells
pancreatic enzymes
lipases
major fat necrosis
necrosis activated bacterial toxins components immune system
complement system
activated natural killer cells
peritoneal macrophages
pathogen induced necrosis programs cells immunological barriers
intestinal mucosa
alleviate invasion pathogens surfaces affected inflammation
toxins pathogens necrosis
toxins snake venoms inhibit enzymes cell death
pathological conditions characterized inadequate secretion cytokines
nitric oxide
reactive oxygen species
ros
accompanied intense necrotic death cells
classic necrotic condition ischemia leads drastic depletion oxygen
glucose trophic factors evokes massive necrotic death endothelial cells proliferating cells surrounding tissues
neurons
cardiomyocytes
renal cells
recent cytological data necrotic death occurs pathological events component physiological process
activation induced death primary lymphocytes
important constituents immune response
caspase independent necrotic morphology
current researchers demonstrated occurrence necrotic cell death occur pathological processes normal processes tissue renewal
embryogenesis immune response
recently
necrosis thought unregulated process
broad pathways necrosis occur organism
pathways initially involves oncosis
swelling cells occur
cell proceeds blebbing
pyknosis
nuclear shrinkage transpires
final step pathway nucleus dissolved cytoplasm
referred karyorrhexis
pathway secondary form necrosis shown occur apoptosis budding
cellular necrosis occur secondary form apoptosis
nucleus breaks fragments
karyolysis
nucleus necrosis characteristics change determined dna broken
shown figure
ways dna broken
karyolysis
pyknosis karyorrhexis
karyolysis process chromatin nucleus fades due loss dna degradation
pyknosis nucleus shrinks chromatin nucleus condenses
karyorrhexis process pyknosis
involves shrunken nucleus proceeding fragmentation nucleus completely disappears
plasma alterations necrosis
plasma membranes discontinuous viewed electron microscope
discontinuous membrane caused cell blebbing loss microvilli
necrosis
treatment based necrosis
treatment necrosis typically involves distinct processes
underlying necrosis treated dead tissue dealt
case ischemia
includes myocardial infarction
restriction blood supply tissues hypoxia creation reactive oxygen species
ros
react
damage proteins membranes
antioxidant treatments applied scavenge ros
wounds caused physical agents
including direct physical trauma injury
treated antibiotics anti inflammatory drugs prevent bacterial infection inflammation
keeping wound clean infection prevents necrosis
chemical toxic agents
pharmaceutical drugs
acids
bases
react skin leading skin loss eventually necrosis
treatment involves identification discontinuation harmful agent
treatment wound
including prevention infection possibly immunosuppressive therapies anti inflammatory drugs immunosuppressants
snake bite
anti venom halts spread toxins whilst receiving antibiotics impede infection
initial necrosis halted
necrotic tissue remain body
body immune response apoptosis
involves automatic breaking recycling cellular material
triggered necrotic cell death due apoptotic pathway disabled
standard therapy necrosis removal dead tissue
debridement
surgical surgical means
depending severity necrosis
range removal small patches skin
complete amputation affected limbs organs
chemical removal necrotic tissue option enzymatic debriding agents
categorised proteolytic
fibrinolytic collangenases
target components dead tissue
select cases
