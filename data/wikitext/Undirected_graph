Graph (mathematics)

graph
mathematics
graph representation set objects pairs objects connected links
interconnected objects represented mathematical abstractions called vertices
links connect pairs vertices called edges
typically
graph depicted diagrammatic form set dots vertices
joined lines curves edges
graphs objects study discrete mathematics
edges directed undirected
vertices represent people party
edge people shake hands
undirected graph
