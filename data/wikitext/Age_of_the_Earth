popularized concept features earth perpetual change
eroding reforming continuously
rate change roughly constant
challenge traditional view
history earth static
brought intermittent catastrophes
naturalists influenced lyell
uniformitarians
believed constant uniform

assumed earth formed completely molten object
determined amount time surface cool present temperature
