Ejaculation

ejaculation
ejaculation ejection semen
carrying sperm
male reproductory tract
accompanied orgasm
final stage natural objective male sexual stimulation
essential component natural conception
rare cases
ejaculation occurs prostatic disease
ejaculation occur spontaneously sleep
nocturnal emission
wet dream
anejaculation condition unable ejaculate
dysejaculation ejaculation painful uncomfortable
usual precursor ejaculation sexual arousal male
leading erection penis
arousal erection leads ejaculation
penile sexual stimulation vaginal
oral anal sexual intercourse
manual stimulation
masturbation
provide stimulus man achieve orgasm ejaculation
men typically reach orgasm minutes start penile vaginal intercourse
taking account desires partners
prolonged stimulation foreplay
kissing
petting direct stimulation erogenous zones penetration intercourse
stroking
masturbation
leads good amount arousal production pre ejaculatory fluid
presence sperm pre ejaculatory fluid thought rare
sperm earlier ejaculation
present urethra
picked pre ejaculatory fluid
citation needed addition
infectious agents
including hiv
present pre ejaculate
premature ejaculation ejaculation occurs desired time
man unable ejaculate timely manner prolonged sexual stimulation
spite desire
called delayed ejaculation anorgasmia
orgasm accompanied ejaculation dry orgasm
man achieved sufficient level stimulation
ejaculation begins

emission
semen ejected urethra rhythmic contractions
rhythmic contractions part male orgasm
generated bulbospongiosus muscle control spinal reflex level spinal nerves pudendal nerve
typical male orgasm lasts seconds
start orgasm
pulses semen begin flow urethra
reach peak discharge diminish flow
typical orgasm consists contractions
man consciously aware
contraction place
ejaculation continue completion involuntary process
stage
ejaculation stopped
rate contractions gradually slows orgasm
initial contractions occur average interval
seconds increasing increment
seconds contraction
contractions men proceed regular rhythmic intervals duration orgasm
men experience additional irregular contractions conclusion orgasm
ejaculation begins contraction orgasm
men spurt occurs contraction
spurt typically largest percent total ejaculate volume
peak flow pulse diminishes
flow ends
muscle contractions orgasm continue additional semen discharge
small sample study men showed average spurts semen

average contractions semen expelled

study found high correlation number spurts semen total ejaculate volume
larger semen volumes resulted additional pulses semen larger individual spurts

masters johnson report ejaculation distance greater
distance ejaculation
sexual functioning
penetration penis vagina distance ejaculation plays role
dribbling semen penis sufficient impregnation
men experience refractory period immediately orgasm
time unable achieve erection
longer period capable achieving ejaculation
time male feels deep pleasurable sense relaxation
felt groin thighs
duration refractory period varies considerably
individual
age affects recovery time
younger men typically recovering faster older men
universally
men achieve sufficient sexual arousal immediately ejaculation
refractory periods fewer minutes
short recovery period seamlessly continue sexual play ejaculation sexual stimulation preparation
men averse stimulation early part refractory period
men achieve multiple orgasms
typical sequence ejaculation refractory period
men report noticing refractory periods
maintain erection
sustaining sexual activity full erection passed refractory time orgasm proceeded orgasm
force amount semen ejected ejaculation vary widely men
milliliters
comparison
note teaspoon tablespoon holds
adult semen volume affected time passed previous ejaculation
larger semen volumes greater durations abstinence
clear frequent ejaculation increases
reduces effect risk prostate cancer
duration stimulation leading ejaculation affect volume
abnormally low volume hypospermia
underlying low volume complete lack semen ejaculatory duct obstruction
normal amount semen diminish age
number sperm ejaculation varies widely
depending factors
including time ejaculation
age
stress levels
testosterone
greater lengths sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation result higher concentrations sperm
unusually low sperm count
low semen volume
oligospermia
absence sperm semen termed azoospermia
ejaculation males occurs months onset puberty
generally masturbation nocturnal emission
wet dreams
semen volume small
typical ejaculation months produces semen
semen produced early puberty typically clear

small percentage men experience transient postorgasmic illness syndrome ejaculation
large studies
ejaculation frequency subsequent risk prostate cancer
sexual factors prostate cancer
suggest frequent ejaculation lifetime offers protection prostate cancer
study involving
men aged years
suggest
high ejaculation frequency related decreased risk total prostate cancer
