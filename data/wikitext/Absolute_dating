word
absolute
implies unwarranted certainty precision
absolute dating computed numerical age contrast relative dating order events
archeology
absolute dating based physical chemical properties materials artifacts
buildings
items modified humans
absolute dates necessarily precisely cultural event happened
part archaeological record invaluable constructing specific sequence events
radiometric dating based constant rate decay radioactive isotopes radiogenic daughter isotopes
isotopes suitable applications function type atoms present rock mineral approximate age
techniques short half lives date materials ages order billions years
detectable amounts radioactive isotopes small measure uncertainty current instruments
widely absolute dating techniques carbon
radiocarbon
dating
date organic remains
radiometric technique based radioactive decay
cosmic radiation entering atmosphere produces carbon
plants carbon fix carbon dioxide
carbon moves food chain animals eat plants predators eat animals
death
uptake carbon stops
takes years half carbon change nitrogen
half life carbon
years quarter original carbon remain
years eighth left
measuring carbon organic material
scientists determine date death organic matter artifact ecofact
short half life carbon
years
makes reliable years
technique pinpoint date archeological site historic records
highly effective precise dates calibrated dating techniques tree ring dating
additional problem carbon dates archeological sites
wood
problem
dry
desert climates
organic materials dead trees remain natural state hundreds years people firewood building materials
part archaeological record
dating tree necessarily fire burned structure built
reason
archaeologists prefer samples short lived plants radiocarbon dating
development accelerator mass spectrometry

argon
noble gas
commonly incorporated samples produced situ radioactive decay
date measured reveals time object heated past closure temperature trapped argon escape lattice
dating calibrate geomagnetic polarity time scale
thermoluminesence testing dates items time heated
technique based principle objects absorb radiation environment
process frees electrons minerals remain caught item
heating item degrees celsius higher releases trapped electrons
producing light
light measured determine time item heated
radiation levels remain constant time
fluctuating levels skew results
item high radiation eras
thermoluminesence return older date item
factors spoil sample testing
exposing sample heat direct light electrons dissipate
causing item date younger
factors

ratio moves equilibrium
process called racemization
