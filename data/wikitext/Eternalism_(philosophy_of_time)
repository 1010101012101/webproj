Eternalism (philosophy of time)

eternalism
eternalism philosophical approach ontological nature time
takes view points time equally
real
opposed presentist idea present real
modern advocates inspiration time modeled dimension theory relativity
giving time similar ontology space
basic idea dates back mctaggart theory time
published unreality time
years paper relativity
time dimension
future events
objective flow time
referred
block time
block universe
theory due description space time unchanging dimensional
block
opposed view world dimensional space modulated passage time
conventionally
time divided distinct regions
past
present
future
representational model
past generally immutably fixed
future undefined nebulous
time passes
moment present part past
part future
turn
present
time pass
distinct present moment
moving
forward future leaving past
view time presentism philosophers
conventional model presents number difficult philosophical problems
difficult reconcile accepted scientific theories theory relativity
special relativity suggests concept simultaneity universal
relativity simultaneity
observers frames reference perceptions pair events happened time times
physical basis preferring frame judgments
case event past light cone event
frames agree happened past
special relativity physical basis picking unique set events happening simultaneously
present
philosophers argued relativity implies eternalism
disagrees qualified sense
philosopher science dean rickles notes
consensus philosophers special general relativity incompatible presentism
christian writes
presentist simply bite bullet relativize existence
present relative inertial frame
exists fragmented depends choice frame
dean zimmerman
argued accept physical predictions relativity adopting alternative interpretation theory
instance
lorentz ether theory
single privileged frame judgments length
time simultaneity
true
absolutely empirical distinguish frame frames
real experience identify
concept
time passing
considered internally inconsistent
time hour
question
fast time pass
satisfactory answer
answers
argue
circular false
addition
accept answer
statement
expressed fraction equal
meaning number wrong kind answer
argument
rate passage time nonsensical
major problem question time space
similarly
space contained meter
face similar objection
unreality time
mctaggart divided time series series
series describing events absolute tensed terms
past
present
future
series describing events terms untensed temporal relations
added notion
series
series order notion time
series letters
argue series needed deserving
time
argued series genuine change
considered change essential part reasonable definition time
argued
series logically incoherent
concluded time unreal
believed series depended series
concluded series remain meaningful ordering
philosophers
identified
theorists
held remaining series qualifies valid framework theory time
called theory time
eternalism addresses difficulties points time equally valid frames equally
real
prefers
concept past future
considers directions states
point time future past dependent frame reference basis observing
observer point time remember events past relative
events future relative
subjective illusion passage time maintained
asymmetry remembering past events future
irreversible events progress temporal direction
increase entropy
rise arrow time
view suggested eternalism
passage time
ticking clock measures durations events marks measuring tape measures distances places
eternalism implications concept free
proposes future events immutably fixed impossible change past events
determinism
human subject
free
present time
life
exercising free future
eternalism makes assumptions
separable
time full fledged real dimension
immutability
consequence
universe indistinguishable fully deterministic worlds interpretation quantum mechanics multiple
growing block universes
citation needed
philosophers john lucas argue
block universe deeply inadequate view time
fails account passage time
pre eminence present
directedness time difference future past
comment summarizes main objections
detail
whilst idea objective sense time flowing denied
fact conscious beings feel sense flowing
flow time objective existence
argued conscious beings simultaneously experience moments lives
response brain perceives time information processing external stimuli
extrasensory perception
obeys laws causality
hard flow time
exists
make subjective difference
conscious beings built perceive time chain events
occurs
common sense attitudes treat past
present future differently
eternalists appeal idea flow time subjective illusion
eternalism takes inspiration physicscitation needed give physical account observers
instance
portray conscious observers moving block universe
physically inexplicable
order account subjective sense flow time
explain subjective flow time
citation needed opponents claim time flow
objective phenomenon
physically inexplicable
physics simply misrepresenting time treating dimension
citation needed
previously
noted people tend attitudes past future
explained underlying attitude future fixed
changed
worth worrying
correct
flow time important intuitions open
undetermined
future
words
flow time theory strictly determined future
nonetheless exist present
satisfy common sense intuitions time
indeterminism removed flow time theories
added eternalist theories

discussion albert einstein
karl popper argued determinism
reality time change crux realism
regard
regarded idealistic opponents realism
visited einstein
schilpp einstein volume library living philosophers published
volume contained famous contribution employed
reality time change
arguments einstein relativity theories
einstein volume strongly favour realism
disagreed idealism
suggested reply solutions cosmological equations
excluded physical grounds
eternalism takes inspiration physics
rietdijk putnam argument
relativity simultaneity show point universe set events present moment
presentism impossible present moment instantaneous encompasses entire universe
philosophers appeal specific theory
timeless
radical sense rest physics
theory quantum gravity

julian barbour theory timelessness

commenting
boethius augustine sound dimensionalist
anselm apparently consistently explicitly embrace position
taneli kukkonen argues oxford handbook medieval philosophy
augustine anselm mix eternalist presentist
tenseless tensed language tells medieval philosophers choose sides
