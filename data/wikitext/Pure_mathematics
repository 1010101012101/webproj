Pure mathematics

pure mathematics
broadly speaking
pure mathematics mathematics studies abstract concepts
eighteenth century onwards
recognized category mathematical activity
characterized speculative mathematics
variance trend meeting navigation
astronomy
physics
engineering
insightful view put pure mathematics necessarily applied mathematics
ancient greek mathematicians earliest make distinction pure applied mathematics
plato helped create gap
arithmetic
called number theory
logistic
called arithmetic
plato regarded logistic

start twentieth century mathematicians axiomatic method
strongly influenced david hilbert
logical formulation pure mathematics suggested bertrand russell terms quantifier structure propositions plausible
large parts mathematics axiomatised subject simple criteria rigorous proof
fact axiomatic setting rigorous adds idea proof
pure mathematics

pure mathematician recognized vocation
achievable training
central concept pure mathematics idea generality
pure mathematics exhibits trend increased generality
generality impact intuition dependent subject matter personal preference learning style
generality hindrance intuition
function aid
analogies material good intuition
prime generality
erlangen program involved expansion geometry accommodate euclidean geometries field topology
forms geometry
viewing geometry study space group transformations
study numbers
called algebra beginning undergraduate level

study functions
called calculus college freshman level mathematical analysis functional analysis advanced level
branches abstract mathematics specialties
fact connections pure mathematics applied mathematics disciplines

discrete mathematics pulls back proof central
mathematicians differing opinions distinction pure applied mathematics
famous
misunderstood
modern examples debate found
hardy mathematician apology
widely believed hardy considered applied mathematics ugly dull
true hardy preferred pure mathematics
compared painting poetry
hardy distinction pure applied mathematics simply applied mathematics sought express physical truth mathematical framework
pure mathematics expressed truths independent physical world
hardy made separate distinction mathematics called

mathematics
insightful view offered magid
analysis concerned properties functions
deals concepts continuity
limits
differentiation integration
providing rigorous foundation calculus infinitesimals introduced newton leibniz century
real analysis studies functions real numbers
complex analysis extends aforementioned concepts functions complex numbers
functional analysis branch analysis studies infinite dimensional vector spaces views functions points spaces
abstract algebra confused manipulation formulae covered secondary education
studies sets binary operations defined
sets binary operations classified properties
instance
operation associative set identity element inverses member set
set operation considered group
structures include rings
fields vector spaces
geometry study shapes space
groups transformations act spaces
projective geometry group projective transformations act real projective plane
inversive geometry concerned group inversive transformations acting extended complex plane
geometry extended topology
deals objects topological spaces continuous maps
topology concerned space connected ignores precise measurements distance angle
number theory theory positive integers
based ideas divisibility congruence
fundamental theorem states positive integer unique prime factorization
ways accessible discipline pure mathematics general public
instance goldbach conjecture easily stated
proved disproved
ways accessible discipline
wiles proof fermat equation nontrivial solutions requires understanding automorphic forms
intrinsic nature found place physics general public discourse
