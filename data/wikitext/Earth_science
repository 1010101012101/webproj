Earth science

earth science
earth science embracing term sciences related planet earth
arguably special case planetary science
earth life bearing planet
reductionist holistic approaches earth sciences
formal discipline earth sciences include study atmosphere
hydrosphere
oceans biosphere
solid earth
typically
earth scientists tools physics
chemistry
biology
chronology mathematics build quantitative understanding earth system works
evolved current state
fields science generally categorized geosciences
plate tectonics
mountain ranges
volcanoes
earthquakes geological phenomena explained terms energy transformations earth crust
beneath earth crust lies mantle heated radioactive decay heavy elements
mantle solid consists magma state semi perpetual convection
convection process lithospheric plates move
albeit slowly
resulting process plate tectonics
plate tectonics thought process earth resurfaced
process called seafloor spreading
crust created flow magma underneath lithosphere surface
fissures
cools solidifies
process called subduction
oceanic crust pushed underground beneath rest contact magma mantle originally
areas crust crust created called divergent boundaries
brought back earth convergent boundaries plates slide past
lithospheric material created destroyed
referred transform
conservative
boundaries earthquakes result movement lithospheric plates
occur convergent boundaries parts crust forced earth part subduction
volcanoes result primarily melting subducted crust material
crust material forced asthenosphere melts
portion melted material light rise birth volcanoes
electromagnet magnet created current flows soft iron core
earth solid iron core surrounded semi liquid materials outer core move continuous currents core
earth electromagnet
referred dynamo theory earth magnetism
troposphere
stratosphere
mesosphere
thermosphere
exosphere layers make earth atmosphere
atmosphere made
nitrogen
oxygen
argon
gases atmosphere located troposphere
bottom layer
remaining percent atmosphere
nitrogen
oxygen
argon
small amounts gases including water vapors
water vapors earth atmosphere catch hold sun energy phenomenon called greenhouse effect
earth surface warm liquid water support life
magnetic field created internal motions core produces magnetosphere protects earth atmosphere solar wind
earth
billion years
lost atmosphere protective magnetosphere
addition storing heat
atmosphere protects living organisms shielding earth surface cosmic rays
note level protection high prevent cosmic rays destroying life earth
low aid mutations important role pushing forward diversity biosphere
