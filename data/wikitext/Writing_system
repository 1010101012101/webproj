Writing system

writing system
writing system organized regular method
typically standardized
information storage transfer communication messages
expressing thoughts ideas
language visually
possibly tactilely
encoding decoding
writing reading
set signs symbols

general attributes writing systems broad categories alphabets
syllabaries
logographies
system attributes category
alphabetic category
standard set letters
basic written symbols graphemes
consonants vowels encode based general principle letters
letter pair
groups
represent phonemes
basic significant sounds
spoken language
syllabary typically correlates symbol syllable
pairing group phonemes
considered building blocks words
logography
character represents word
morpheme semantic unit
pairings groups syllables
categories include abjads
alphabet vowels
abugidas
called alphasyllabaries
vowels shown diacritics modification consonants
system category determined identifying number symbols system
alphabets typically set symbols fully express language
syllabaries
logographies hundreds symbols
systems typically ordering symbol elements groups coded larger clusters words acronyms
generally lexemes
giving rise possibilities
permutations
meanings symbols convey
systems enable concatenation
stringing
smaller groupings
referred generic term character strings
order enable full expression language
reading step accomplished reader purely mind internal process
expressed verbally
typically
reading aloud
historically
writing systems developed spoken language established
individual symbols
typically ideogram
preceded spoken word
special set symbols punctuation aid structure organization writing systems capture nuances variations message meaning communicated verbally cues timing
tone
accent
inflection intonation
writing system typically method formatting recorded messages spoken version rules grammar syntax reader meaning intended message accurately preserved
writing systems preceded proto writing
pictograms
ideograms mnemonic symbols
proto writing lacked ability capture express full range thoughts ideas
invention writing systems
dates back beginning bronze age late neolithic era late millennium bce
enabled accurate durable recording human history manner prone types error oral history vulnerable
provided reliable form long distance communication
advent publishing
provided medium early form mass communication
secure written communications made reliable invention encryption

writing systems generally change slowly spoken counterparts
preserve features expressions longer current spoken language
great benefits writing systems preserve permanent record information expressed language
writing systems require
examination individual scripts
study writing systems developed partially independent lines
terminology employed differs field field
generic term text refers instance written material
act composing recording text referred writing
act viewing interpreting text reading
orthography refers method rules observed writing structure
literal meaning

alphabetic systems
includes concept spelling
grapheme specific base unit writing system
graphemes minimally significant elements comprise set
