utility applied generate individual price asset called indifference price
utility functions related risk measures
common entropic risk measure
recognized utility measured observed directly
economists devised infer underlying relative utilities observed choice
revealed preferences

utility correlative desire
argued desires measured directly
indirectly
outward phenomena give rise

economists distinguish cardinal utility ordinal utility
cardinal utility
magnitude utility differences treated ethically behaviorally significant quantity
hand
ordinal utility captures ranking strength preferences
utility functions sorts assign ranking members choice set
suppose cup orange juice utility utils
cup tea utility utils
cup water utility utils
speaking cardinal utility
concluded cup orange juice cup tea amount cup tea cup water
entitled conclude
cup tea thirds good cup juice
conclusion depend magnitudes utility differences

tempting dealing cardinal utility aggregate utilities persons
argument interpersonal comparisons utility meaningless good interpret people consumption bundles
ordinal utilities
differences utils treated ethically behaviorally meaningless
utility index encode full behavioral ordering members choice set
tells related strength preferences
juice preferred tea water
neoclassical economics largely retreated cardinal utility functions basic objects economic analysis
favor agent preferences choice sets
preference relations represented utility functions satisfying properties
ordinal utility functions unique positive monotone transformations
cardinal utilities unique positive linear transformations
