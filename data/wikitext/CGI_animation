computer animation
computer animation process generating animated images computer graphics
general term computer generated imagery encompasses static scenes dynamic images
computer animation refers moving images
modern computer animation graphics
graphics stylistic
low bandwidth

computer animation essentially digital successor stop motion techniques traditional animation models frame frame animation illustrations
computer generated animations controllable physically based processes
constructing miniatures effects shots hiring extras crowd scenes
creation images feasible technology
