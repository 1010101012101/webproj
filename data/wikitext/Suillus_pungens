studies investigated role
coastal californian forest ecosystem occupies
species produces fruit bodies competing ectomycorrhizal fungi location
dominant root colonizer
occupies small percentage ectomycorrhizal root tips

study
mycologists monique gardes thomas bruns hypothesized
abundant fruiter pine forests
dominant roots pine trees
sampling underground ectomycorrhizae addition ground fruit bodies
found fungus fruit prolifically occupying small fraction ectomycorrhizal root assemblage
dominated russula species tomentella sublilacina
gardes bruns hypothesized disparity ground representation fungus invests energy vegetative growth persistence fruiting
alternatively
species efficient acquiring carbon hosts colonize rootlets obtain abundant fruiting
study pierluigi bonello colleagues single strand conformation polymorphism analysis detect minute genetic differences
genets
showed fruiting occurred single large genet
result fungus persists extensive vegetative growth
frequent establishment genets spores
carbon resources efficiently

demonstrating survive absence host
suggesting spores primary means fungus recolonizes fire
