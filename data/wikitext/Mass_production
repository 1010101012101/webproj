mass production involves making copies products
quickly
assembly line techniques send partially complete products workers work individual step
worker work product start finish
mass production fluid matter typically involves pipes centrifugal pumps screw conveyors
augers
transfer raw materials partially complete product vessels

electrification factories fastest
aided establishment electric utilities central stations lowering electricity prices
electric motors times efficient small steam engines central station generation efficient small steam engines line shafts belts high friction losses
electric motors allowed flexibility manufacturing required maintenance line shafts belts
factories increase output changing electric motors
electrification enabled modern mass production

mass production popularized needed henry ford ford motor company
introduced electric motors technique chain sequential production
ford bought designed built special purpose machine tools fixtures multiple spindle drill presses drill hole side engine block operation multiple head milling machine simultaneously machine engine blocks held single fixture
machine tools arranged systematically production flow special carriages rolling heavy items machining position
production ford model machine tools
processes factory capable turning high precision work tolerances
ford contribution mass production synthetic nature
collating improving existing methods sequential production applying electric power
resulting extremely high throughput
continuous flow mass production

parts assembling
locate tools times varying tasks
mass production
worker repeats related tasks tool perform identical identical operations stream products
exact tool parts hand
moved assembly line consecutively
worker spends time retrieving
preparing materials tools
time manufacture product mass production shorter traditional methods
probability human error variation reduced
tasks predominantly carried machinery
reduction labour costs
increased rate production
enables company produce larger quantity product lower cost traditional
linear methods
mass production inflexible difficult alter design production process production line implemented

introducing variety satisfy individual tastes easy
variety achieved applying finishes decorations end production line
ford model produced tremendous affordable output good responding demand variety
customization

consequence ford eventually lost market share general motors
introduced annual model
