popular programming languages
client server web applications
reported million users
java originally developed james gosling sun microsystems
merged oracle corporation
released core component sun microsystems java platform
language derives syntax
fewer low level facilities
original reference implementation java compilers
virtual machines
class libraries developed sun released
compliance specifications java community process
sun relicensed java technologies gnu general public license
developed alternative implementations sun technologies
gnu compiler java gnu classpath

patrick naughton initiated java language project june
java originally designed interactive television
advanced digital cable television industry time
language initially called oak oak tree stood gosling office
green
renamed java
java coffee
consumed large quantities language creators
gosling aimed implement virtual machine language familiar
style notation
sun microsystems released public implementation java
promised
write
run
wora
providing cost run times popular platforms
fairly secure featuring configurable security
allowed network file access restrictions
major web browsers incorporated ability run java applets web pages
java quickly popular
advent java
released initially
december
versions multiple configurations built types platforms
targeted enterprise applications greatly stripped version mobile applications
mobile java
designated standard edition
marketing purposes
sun renamed versions java

java
sun microsystems approached iso
iec standards body ecma international formalize java
withdrew process
java remains facto standard
controlled java community process
time
sun made java implementations charge
proprietary software status
sun generated revenue java selling licenses specialized products java enterprise system
sun distinguishes software development kit
sdk
runtime environment
jre
subset sdk
primary distinction involves jre lack compiler
utility programs
header files
november
sun released java free open source software
foss
terms gnu general public license
gpl
sun finished process
making java core code free software
open source distribution terms
small portion code sun hold copyright
sun vice president rich green sun ideal role java

primary goals creation java language
major release versions java
release dates
characteristic java portability
means computer programs written java language run similarly hardware
operating system platform
achieved compiling java language code intermediate representation called java bytecode
directly platform specific machine code
java bytecode instructions analogous machine code
intended interpreted virtual machine
written specifically host hardware
end users commonly java runtime environment
jre
installed machine standalone java applications
web browser java applets
standardized libraries provide generic access host specific features graphics
threading
networking
major benefit bytecode porting
overhead interpretation means interpreted programs run slowly programs compiled native executables
time
jit
compilers introduced early stage compile bytecodes machine code runtime

openjdk notable java implementation licensed gpl
implementation started sun began releasing java source code gpl
java
openjdk official java reference implementation
goal java make implementations java compatible
historically
sun trademark license usage java brand insists implementations
compatible
resulted legal dispute microsoft sun claimed microsoft implementation support rmi jni added platform specific features
sun sued
won settlement million
court order enforcing terms license sun
result
microsoft longer ships windows java
platform independent java essential java
rigorous validation required certify implementation
environment enables portable server side applications
programs written java reputation slower requiring memory written
java programs execution speed improved significantly introduction time compilation
java
addition language features supporting code analysis
classes
stringbuffer class
optional assertions
optimizations java virtual machine
hotspot default sun jvm
december
microbenchmarks show java approximately slower
platforms offer direct hardware support java
microcontrollers run java hardware software java virtual machine
arm based processors hardware support executing java bytecode jazelle option
java automatic garbage collector manage memory object lifecycle
programmer determines objects created
java runtime responsible recovering memory objects longer
references object remain
unreachable memory eligible freed automatically garbage collector
similar memory leak occur programmer code holds reference object longer needed
typically objects longer needed stored containers
methods nonexistent object called
null pointer exception
thrown
ideas java automatic memory management model programmers spared burden perform manual memory management
languages
memory creation objects implicitly allocated stack
explicitly allocated deallocated heap
case responsibility managing memory resides programmer
program deallocate object
memory leak occurs
program attempts access deallocate memory deallocated
result undefined difficult predict
program unstable
crash
partially remedied smart pointers
add overhead complexity
note garbage collection prevent
logical
memory leaks
memory referenced
garbage collection happen time
ideally
occur program idle
guaranteed triggered insufficient free memory heap allocate object
program stall momentarily
explicit memory management java
java support
style pointer arithmetic
object addresses unsigned integers
long integers
interchangeably
garbage collector relocate referenced objects ensures type safety security
object oriented languages
variables java primitive data types objects
values primitive types stored directly fields
objects
stack
methods
heap
commonly true objects
escape analysis
conscious decision java designers performance reasons
java considered pure object oriented programming language
java
autoboxing enables programmers proceed primitive types instances wrapper class
java multiple types garbage collectors
default
hotspot concurrent mark sweep collector
cms garbage collector
garbage collectors manage heap
applications java
cms garbage collector good
syntax java largely derived
unlike
combines syntax structured
generic
object oriented programming
java built exclusively object oriented language
code written inside class
object
exception primitive data types
integers
floating point numbers
boolean values
characters
classes performance reasons
unlike
java support operator overloading multiple inheritance classes
simplifies language aids preventing potential errors anti pattern design
