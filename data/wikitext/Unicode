reasons justify approach
applications documents rarely render characters writing systems
fonts tend demand resources computing environments
operating systems applications show increasing intelligence regard obtaining glyph information separate font files needed
font substitution
designing consistent set rendering instructions tens thousands glyphs constitutes monumental task
venture passes point diminishing returns typefaces
unicode partially addresses line problem occurs read text file platforms
