astronomical chronology
astronomical dating
technical method dating events artifacts astronomical phenomena
written records historical events include descriptions astronomical phenomena clarify chronology ancient east
works art depict configuration stars planets buildings oriented rising setting celestial bodies time dated astronomical calculations
astronomical dating powerful tool establishing absolute chronologies
easily produce precise impressive results based invalid assumptions results precise impressive questioned scholars fields
descriptions astronomical phenomena date historical events began century
time renewed humanistic interest history increasingly precise astronomical tables
eclipses infrequent events dated precisely
circumstances exact descriptions leave ambiguities
details month eclipse position stars planets identify specific eclipse
astronomical dating
forms historical interpretation
requires care interpreting surviving written records
john steele proposed questions asked dating event
record refer actual astronomical event
modern assumption
refer actual astronomical event
source reliable
record provide unambiguous date making unwarranted assumptions ancient astronomical observational methods
babylonian astronomical diaries provide detailed unambiguous accounts positions visible planets
relation specific stars
provide precise dates events defeat darius iii alexander great battle gaugamela october bce alexander subsequent death june
success method depends reliability written sources precision accounts astronomical phenomena
attempts date literary texts describe astronomical events loosely metaphors led researchers conclusions precise
rely invalid assumptions widely accepted
attempts date vedic texts describing pleiades rising
due east
bce
time pleiades rose
due east
complicated fact poetic descriptions reflecting precise astronomical observations
precession slow process makes small azimuth star rising east
artifacts readily dated astronomical techniques depictions positions celestial bodies time
motions celestial bodies periods
takes centuries planets sun moon
reach positions signs zodiac
configuration accurate
single sign
positions bodies return configuration years
case involved medieval illuminated manuscript portrayed position celestial bodies march
period manuscript written
calculation demonstrated illustration copy earlier classical depiction position stars
rapidly moving moon sensitive indicator exact time
estimate position moon degree
time diagram computed hour
striking method astrological portrait sir christopher hatton
depicted positions classical planets zodiac noted computed positions planets nearest minute arc
largest source error date uncertainty century astronomical calculations
resulting time noon december
controversial archaeoastronomical approach date structures believed oriented astronomical principles measuring orientation computing date past single celestial body
sun selected star
rises sets measured azimuth

mistrust dates established slowly changing obliquity ecliptic stellar alignments
involve arbitrary selection star rises proper azimuth
proposed method employing historical records dates construction greek temples
festivals specific temples
nature greek lunisolar calendar
date festival greek lunisolar calendar recurs date solar calendar nineteen years
dinsmoor identified festival connected specific temple determine exact year historically recorded construction date sun rose alignment temple date festival
