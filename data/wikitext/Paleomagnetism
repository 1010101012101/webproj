study record earth magnetic field rocks
minerals rocks lock record direction intensity magnetic field form
record information past behavior earth magnetic field past location tectonic plates
record geomagnetic reversals preserved volcanic sedimentary rock sequences
magnetostratigraphy
time scale geochronologic tool
geophysicists specialize paleomagnetism called paleomagnetists
paleomagnetists led revival continental drift hypothesis transformation plate tectonics
apparent polar wander paths provided clear geophysical evidence continental drift
marine magnetic anomalies seafloor spreading
paleomagnetism continues extend history plate tectonics back time applied movement continental fragments
terranes
paleomagnetism relied heavily developments rock magnetism
turn provided foundation applications magnetism
include biomagnetism
magnetic fabrics
strain indicators rocks soils
environmental magnetism
early century noticed compass needles deviated strongly magnetized outcrops
von humboldt attributed magnetization lightning strikes
lightning strikes magnetize surface rocks
century studies direction magnetization rocks showed recent lavas magnetized parallel earth magnetic field
early century

brunhes mercanton showed rocks magnetized antiparallel field
motonori matuyama showed earth magnetic field reversed mid quaternary

british physicist
blackett provided major impetus paleomagnetism inventing sensitive astatic magnetometer
intent test theory geomagnetic field related earth rotation
theory ultimately rejected
astatic magnetometer basic tool paleomagnetism led revival theory continental drift
alfred wegener proposed continents joined moved
produced abundance circumstantial evidence
theory met acceptance reasons
mechanism continental drift
reconstruct movements continents time

irving constructed apparent polar wander paths europe north america
curves diverged
reconciled assumed continents contact million years ago
provided clear geophysical evidence continental drift
