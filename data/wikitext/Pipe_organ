Pipe organ

pipe organ
pipe organ musical instrument commonly churches cathedrals produces sound driving pressurized air
called wind
pipes selected keyboard
organ pipe produces single pitch
pipes provided sets called ranks
common timbre volume keyboard compass
organs multiple ranks pipes differing timbre
pitch loudness player employ singly combination controls called stops
pipe organ keyboards
called manuals
played hands
pedalboard played feet
group stops
organ continuous supply wind sustain notes long keys depressed
unlike piano harpsichord sound begins decay immediately attack
