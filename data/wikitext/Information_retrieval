information retrieval
information retrieval activity obtaining information resources relevant information collection information resources
searches based metadata full text indexing
automated information retrieval systems reduce called

information retrieval process begins user enters query system
queries formal statements information
search strings web search engines
information retrieval query uniquely identify single object collection
objects match query
degrees relevancy
object entity represented information database
user queries matched database information
depending application data objects
text documents
images
audio
mind maps videos
documents stored directly system
represented system document surrogates metadata
systems compute numeric score object database matches query
rank objects
top ranking objects shown user
process iterated user wishes refine query
measures evaluating performance information retrieval systems proposed
measures require collection documents query
common measures assume ground truth notion relevancy
document relevant relevant query
practice queries posed shades relevancy
precision fraction documents retrieved relevant user information
binary classification
precision analogous positive predictive
precision takes retrieved documents account
evaluated cut rank
