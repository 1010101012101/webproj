early schmidhuber invented neural method nonlinear independent component analysis
ica
called predictability minimization
based evolution adaptive predictors initially random
adaptive feature detectors processing input patterns environment
detector predictor predict current values neighboring detectors
detector simultaneously unpredictable
shown detectors create factorial code environment
code conveys information inputs code components statistically independent
desirable pattern recognition applications
