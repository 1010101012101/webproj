commutative algebra main technical tool local study schemes
study rings necessarily commutative noncommutative algebra
includes ring theory
representation theory
theory banach algebras
subject
ideal theory
began richard dedekind work ideals
based earlier work ernst kummer leopold kronecker
david hilbert introduced term ring generalize earlier term number ring
hilbert introduced abstract approach replace concrete computationally oriented methods grounded things complex analysis classical invariant theory
turn
hilbert strongly influenced emmy noether
owe abstract axiomatic approach subject
important milestone work hilbert student emanuel lasker
introduced primary ideals proved version theorem
modern development commutative algebra emphasizes modules
ideals ring algebras special cases modules
module theory encompasses ideal theory theory ring extensions
incipient kronecker work
modern approach commutative algebra module theory credited emmy noether
