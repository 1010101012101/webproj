tsunami
tsunami
plural
tsunamis tsunami
japanese
lit
harbour wave
english pronunciation
soo nah mee
tsoo nah mee
series water waves caused displacement large volume body water
typically ocean large lake
earthquakes
volcanic eruptions underwater explosions
including detonations underwater nuclear devices
landslides
glacier calvings
meteorite impacts disturbances water potential generate tsunami
tsunami waves resemble normal sea waves
wavelength longer
appearing breaking wave
tsunami initially resemble rapidly rising tide
reason referred tidal waves
tsunamis generally consist series waves periods ranging minutes hours
arriving called
wave train
wave heights tens metres generated large events
impact tsunamis limited coastal areas
destructive power enormous affect entire ocean basins
indian ocean tsunami deadliest natural disasters human history people killed countries bordering indian ocean
greek historian thucydides suggested tsunamis related submarine earthquakes
understanding tsunami nature remained slim century remains unknownclarify
major areas current research include determine large earthquakes generate tsunamis smaller
accurately forecast passage tsunamis oceans
forecast tsunami waves interact specific shorelines

tsunami referred tidal waves
recent years
term fallen favor
scientific community
tsunami tides
popular term derives common appearance
extraordinarily high tidal bore
tsunami tides produce waves water move inland
case tsunami inland movement water greater lasts longer period
giving impression incredibly high tide

earthquakes varying magnitudes regularly occurring coast island
principal generation mechanism
tsunami displacement substantial volume water perturbation sea
displacement water attributed earthquakes
landslides
volcanic eruptions
glacier calvings rarely meteorites nuclear tests
waves formed sustained gravity
tides play part generation tsunamis
tsunami generated sea floor abruptly deforms vertically displaces overlying water
tectonic earthquakes kind earthquake earth crustal deformation
earthquakes occur beneath sea
water deformed area displaced equilibrium position
specifically
tsunami generated thrust faults convergent destructive plate boundaries move abruptly
resulting water displacement
owing vertical component movement involved
movement normal faults displacement seabed
size largest events small give rise significant tsunami
drawing tectonic plate boundary earthquake
overriding plate bulges strain
causing tectonic uplift
plate slips
causing subsidence releasing energy water
energy released produces tsunami waves
