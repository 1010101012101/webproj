algebraic number theory
algebraic number theory major branch number theory studies algebraic structures related algebraic integers
generally accomplished ring algebraic integers algebraic number field
studying algebraic properties factorization
behaviour ideals
field extensions
setting
familiar features unique hold
virtue primary machinery theory

unique factorization partially recovered property unique factorization ideals prime ideals
dedekind domain
makes study prime ideals important
area things change
prime numbers
generate prime ideals
fact
single prime ideal form

longer generate prime ideals
ring gaussian integers

generalizing simple result general rings integers basic problem algebraic number theory
class field theory accomplishes goal abelian extension
galois extension abelian galois group
important generalization notion prime ideal obtained passing called ideal theoretic approach called valuation theoretic approach
relation approaches arises
addition usual absolute function
absolute functions
defined prime number
called adic absolute values
ostrowski theorem states absolute functions
equivalence
suggests usual absolute considered prime
generally
prime algebraic number field
called place

absolute values obtained subset complex numbers ways absolute
prime kind called finite prime
finite place
kind called infinite prime
infinite place
set primes generally denoted
usual absolute denoted context
set infinite primes explicitly terms embeddings
ring homomorphisms
specifically
set embeddings split disjoint subsets
image contained
rest
embedding
corresponds unique prime coming absolute obtained composing usual absolute
prime arising fashion called real prime
real place
embedding
image contained
construct distinct embedding
called conjugate embedding
composing complex conjugation map
pair embeddings
corresponds unique prime obtained composing usual absolute
composing absolute function complex number
denotes complex conjugate
prime called complex prime
complex place
description set infinite primes
infinite prime corresponds unique embedding
pair conjugate embeddings
number real
complex
primes denoted
total number embeddings
fact
equals degree extension
fundamental theorem arithmetic describes multiplicative structure
states integer written
essentially
uniquely product prime powers
unique factorization ideals ring recovers part description

units
generally
invertible elements form group multiplication called unit group

dirichlet unit theorem describes abstract structure unit group abelian group
precise statement giving structure galois module galois group
size unit group
lattice structure give important numerical information
class number formula
completing number field place complete field
valuation archimedean
archimedean lies prime rationals
finite extension
complete
discrete valued field finite residue field
process simplifies arithmetic field local study problems
theorem deduced easily analogous local statement
philosophy study local fields largely motivated geometric methods
algebraic geometry
common study varieties locally point localizing maximal ideal
global information recovered gluing local data
spirit adopted algebraic number theory
