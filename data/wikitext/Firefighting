Firefighting

firefighting
firefighting act extinguishing fires
firefighter fights fires prevent loss life
destruction property environment
firefighting highly technical skill requires professionals spent years training general firefighting techniques specialized areas expertise
organised teams bucket brigades syringes douse fire
public fire fighting roman republic
private individuals rely slaves supporters action
action involve razing nearby buildings prevent spread fire bucket brigades
wealthy marcus licinius crassus infamous literal fire sales
buy burning buildings

organized fire fighting force ancient rome augustus era
prior great fire london
parishes begun organise rudimentary firefighting
london destroyed
fire insurance introduced man named nicholas barbon
reduce cost
barbon formed fire brigade
eventually companies
start
insurance badge mark attach properties

buildings coverage insurance company left burn adjacent insured building case insurance company interest prevent fire spreading
companies london merged form london fire company establishment
steam powered apparatuses introduced
allowing greater quantity water directed fire
steam powered appliances replaced early invention internal combustion engine
firefighters goals save lives
