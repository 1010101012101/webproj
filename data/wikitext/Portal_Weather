weather encompassing term describe varied phenomena occur atmosphere planet time
term refers activity phenomena short periods hours days
opposed term climate
refers average atmospheric conditions longer periods time
qualification
weather
understood weather earth
weather results temperature differences place
caused sun heating areas equator poles
areas earth absorbing varying amounts heat
due differences albedo
moisture
cloud cover
surface temperature differences turn pressure differences
hot surface heats air air expands
lowering air pressure
resulting pressure gradient accelerates air high low pressure
creating wind
earth rotation curvature flow coriolis effect
simple systems interact
producing complex systems
weather phenomena
strong temperature contrast polar tropical air rise jet stream
weather phenomena mid latitudes caused instabilities jet stream flow
baroclinity
weather fronts
weather systems tropics caused processes
monsoons organized thunderstorm systems
earth axis tilted relative orbital plane
sunlight incident angles times year
june northern hemisphere tilted sun
december tilted
causing yearly weather seasons
mid latitudes
winter weather includes snow sleet
mid latitudes tropics
