geochemical method determining age absolute relative terms artifact made obsidian
obsidian volcanic glass raw material manufacture stone tools projectile points
knives
cutting tools process flintknapping
obsidian obeys property mineral hydration
absorbs water
exposed air
defined rate
unworked nodule obsidian initially fractured
typically water present

obsidian hydration dating introduced irving friedman robert smith
geological survey
initial work focused obsidians archaeological sites western north america
secondary ion mass spectrometry

measurement obsidian hydration dating introduced independent research teams
today technique applied extensively archaeologists date prehistoric sites sites protohistory california great basin north america
applied south america
middle east
pacific islands
including zealand mediterranean basin
measure hydration band
small slice material typically cut artifact
sample ground micrometers thick mounted petrographic slide
hydration rind measured high power microscope outfitted method measuring distance
typically tenths micrometers
technician measures microscopic amount water absorbed freshly broken surfaces
principle obsidian hydration dating longer artifact surface exposed
thicker hydration band
case measuring hydration rim depth profiling ability secondary ion mass spectrometry technique
sample mounted holder preparation cutting
method measurement destructive
factors complicate simple correlation obsidian hydration band thickness absolute age
temperature speed hydration process
artifacts exposed higher temperatures
lower elevation
hydrate faster
