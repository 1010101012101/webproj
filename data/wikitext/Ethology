neuroethology
understanding ethology animal behaviour important animal training
natural behaviours species breeds enables trainer select individuals suited perform required task

jean baptiste lamarck
biologist describe complex theory evolution
theory substantially comprised statements
animal organs behaviour change
characteristics transmit generation

konrad lorenz due teacher
oskar heinroth
identification fixed action patterns
faps
lorenz popularized faps instinctive responses occur reliably presence identifiable stimuli
called sign stimuli releasing stimuli
faps compared species
similarities differences behaviour easily compared similarities differences morphology
important quoted study anatidae
ducks geese
heinroth technique
ethologists noted stimuli released faps commonly features appearance behaviour members animal species
prove important forms animal communication mediated simple faps
sophisticated investigation kind study karl von frisch called
dance language
related bee communication
lorenz developed interesting theory evolution animal communication based observations nature fixed action patterns circumstances animals emit
merriam webster dictionary defines instinct largely inheritable unalterable tendency organism make complex specific response environmental stimuli involving reason
ethologists
instinct means series predictable behaviours fixed action patterns
schemes acted precise stimulating signal present
signals act communication members species
releasers
notable releaser beak movements bird species performed newly hatched chicks
stimulates mother regurgitating process feed offspring
case classic experiments tinbergen graylag goose
similar waterfowl
goose rolls displaced egg nest back beak
sight displaced egg triggers mechanism
egg
animal continues behaviour
pulling head back imaginary egg manoeuvred underside beak
attempts move egg shaped objects
giant plaster egg

objects
exaggerate releasers found natural objects
elicit stronger version behavior natural object
goose ignores displaced egg favour giant dummy egg
exaggerated releasers instincts named supernormal stimuli tinbergen
tinbergen found produce supernormal stimuli instincts cardboard butterflies male butterflies preferred mate darker stripes real female
dummy fish territorial male stickleback fish fought violently real invading male dummy brighter coloured underside
harvard psychologist deirdre barrett research pointing easily humans respond supernormal stimuli sexual
nurturing
feeding
social instincts
behaviour made fixed action patterns rigid inefficient
reducing probability survival reproduction
learning process great importance

sense guided experience stereotyped faps
learning occurs ways
elementary habituation
process decrease elicited behaviour resulting repeated presentation eliciting stimulus
effect
animal learns stop responding irrelevant stimuli
learning habituation observed squirrels
feels threatened
hear signal nearest refuge
signal individual caused false alarms
squirrels ignore signal
common learning association

studies associative learning made russian physiologist ivan pavlov
associative behaviour observed common goldfish close water surface human feed
excitement dog sees collar prelude walk
discriminate members species fundamental importance reproductive success
discrimination based number factors
important type learning takes place limited period time
kind learning called imprinting
important finding lorenz
lorenz observed young birds geese chickens mothers spontaneously day hatched
discovered response imitated arbitrary stimulus eggs incubated artificially stimulus presented critical period continued days hatching
imitation advanced behaviour animal observes replicates behaviour
national institutes health reported capuchin monkeys preferred company researchers imitated researchers
monkeys spent time imitators preferred engage simple task provided option performing task imitator

social life
animals fight reproduce
social supremacy
common fighting social sexual supremacy called pecking order poultry
time group poultry cohabitate time length

animal species

tend live groups
group size major aspect social environment
social life complex effective survival strategy
regarded sort symbiosis individuals species
society composed group individuals belonging species living defined rules food management
role assignments reciprocal dependence
biologists interested evolution theory started examining social behaviour
apparently unanswerable questions arose
birth sterile castes
