studies fail define term discipline explicitly
typically assume boundaries disciplines closely academic departments
boundaries fix overly concrete limits highly abstract phenomenon
excluding large number people interest subject
importance creating maintaining disciplinary communities makes academic department building block disciplines created
fields study disciplines branches
distinguishing lines arbitrary ambiguous
multidisciplinary knowledge existing academic discipline profession

key question challenge decomposed separable subparts
addressed distributed knowledge community project team
lack shared vocabulary people communication overhead additional challenge communities projects
similar challenges type repeatedly addressed
challenge properly decomposed
multidisciplinary community exceptionally efficient effective
