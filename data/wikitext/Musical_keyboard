keyboard instruments types require techniques
piano hammer mechanism produces louder note faster key pressed harpsichord plectrum mechanism perceptibly vary volume note touch keyboard
pipe organ volume timbre controlled flow air bellows stops preselected player
players instruments techniques color sound
arranger keyboard preset produce range voices percussion accompaniments respond chords played left hand
keyboard layout simple notes easily accessible
playing requires skill
proficient player undertaken training play accurately tempo
beginners seldom produce passable rendition simple piece due lack technique
sequences movements players hands complicated
problems include wide spanned chords
difficult people small hands
chords require unusual hand positions initially uncomfortable
fast scales
trills arpeggios
playing instruments velocity sensitive
