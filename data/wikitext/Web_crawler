Web crawler

web crawler
web crawler internet bot systematically browses world wide web
typically purpose web indexing
web crawler called web spider
ant
automatic indexer
foaf software context
web scutter
web search engines sites web crawling spidering software update web content indexes sites web content
web crawlers copy pages visit processing search engine indexes downloaded pages users search quickly
crawlers validate hyperlinks html code
web scraping
data driven programming
web crawler starts list urls visit
called seeds
crawler visits urls
identifies hyperlinks page adds list urls visit
called crawl frontier
urls frontier recursively visited set policies
large volume implies crawler download limited number web pages time
prioritize downloads
high rate change implies pages updated deleted
number crawlable urls generated server side software made difficult web crawlers avoid retrieving duplicate content
endless combinations
url based
parameters exist
small selection return unique content
simple online photo gallery offer options users
parameters url
exist ways sort images
choices thumbnail size
file formats
option disable user provided content
set content accessed urls
linked site
mathematical combination creates problem crawlers
sort endless combinations minor scripted order retrieve unique content

importance page crawler expressed function similarity page query
web crawlers attempt download pages similar called focused crawler topical crawlers
concepts topical focused crawling introduced menczer chakrabarti
main problem focused crawling context web crawler
predict similarity text page query downloading page
predictor anchor text links
approach pinkerton web crawler early days web
diligenti
propose complete content pages visited infer similarity driving query pages visited
performance focused crawling depends richness links specific topic searched
focused crawling relies general web search engine providing starting points
crawler seek html pages avoid mime types
order request html resources
crawler make head request determine web resource mime type requesting entire resource request
avoid making numerous head requests
crawler examine url request resource url ends characters
html
htm
asp
aspx
php
jsp
jspx slash
strategy numerous html web resources unintentionally skipped
crawlers avoid requesting resources
dynamically produced
order avoid spider traps crawler download infinite number urls web site
strategy unreliable site rewrite engine simplify urls
crawlers perform type url normalization order avoid crawling resource
term url normalization
called url canonicalization
refers process modifying standardizing url consistent manner
types normalization performed including conversion urls lowercase
removal
segments
adding trailing slashes empty path component
crawlers intend download resources web site

simple visiting policies studied cho garcia molina
uniform policy
involves visiting pages collection frequency
rates change
proportional policy
involves visiting pages change frequently
visiting frequency directly proportional
estimated
change frequency
cases
repeated crawling order pages random fixed order
cho garcia molina proved surprising result
terms average freshness
uniform policy outperforms proportional policy simulated web real web crawl
intuitively
reasoning
web crawlers limit pages crawl time frame
allocate crawls rapidly changing pages expense frequently updating pages
freshness rapidly changing pages lasts shorter period frequently changing pages
words
proportional policy allocates resources crawling frequently updating pages
experiences freshness time
improve freshness
crawler penalize elements change
optimal visiting policy uniform policy proportional policy
optimal method keeping average freshness high includes ignoring pages change
optimal keeping average age low access frequencies monotonically
linearly
increase rate change page
cases
optimal closer uniform policy proportional policy

important lack detail prevents reproducing work
emerging concerns
search engine spamming
prevent major search engines publishing ranking algorithms
web crawlers typically identify web server user agent field request
web site administrators typically examine web servers log user agent field determine crawlers visited web server
user agent field include url web site administrator find information crawler
examining web server log tedious task administrators tools crawltrack seo crawlytics identify
track verify web crawlers
spambots malicious web crawlers place identifying information user agent field

important web crawlers identify web site administrators contact owner needed
cases
crawlers accidentally trapped crawler trap overloading web server requests
