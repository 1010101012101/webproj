fred jay seaver commented
illustration unusual unpredictable distribution species fungi
difficult account
accept facts
research study compared dna sequences populations combination molecular phylogenetics molecular clock calculations estimate extent genetic divergence
concluded populations separated nineteen million years
ruling possibility human introduction species location
consistent differences morphology populations
differences life histories
preferred host texan populations typically roots stumps ulmus crassifola
japanese populations tend grow fallen trunks symplocos myrtaceae quercus gilva
texan species grow areas subjected periodic flooding
unlike japanese counterparts
finally
japanese specimens grown spores texan material successfully germinated artificial media
