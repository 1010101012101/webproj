Deposition (aerosol physics)

deposition
aerosol physics
deposition process aerosol particles collect deposit solid surfaces
decreasing concentration particles air
divided processes
dry wet deposition
rate deposition
deposition velocity
slowest particles intermediate size
mechanisms deposition effective small large particles
large particles settle quickly sedimentation
settling
impaction processes
brownian diffusion greatest influence small particles
small particles coagulate hours achieve diameter
micrometers

diffusion constant time
integrated determine concentration moment time
dry deposition caused
wet deposition
atmospheric hydrometeors
rain drops
