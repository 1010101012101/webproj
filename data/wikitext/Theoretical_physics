cases
theoretical physics adheres standards mathematical rigor giving weight experiments observations
developing special relativity
albert einstein concerned lorentz transformation left maxwell equations invariant
apparently uninterested experiment earth drift luminiferous ether
hand
einstein awarded nobel prize explaining photoelectric effect

simpler theories describe matter adequately preferred
conceptual simplicity mathematical complexity
accepted connect wide range phenomena
testing consequences theory part scientific method
physical theories grouped categories
