Epoch (reference date)

epoch
fields chronology periodization
epoch instant time chosen origin era
epoch
serves reference point time measured
time measurement units counted epoch date time events unambiguously
events taking place epoch dated counting negatively epoch
pragmatic periodization practice
epochs defined past
epoch start era
serving ending older preceding era
purpose criteria definitions clarify ordinate scholarship period
times
disciplines
epochs generally chosen convenient significant consensus time scale initial users
authoritarian fiat
epoch moment date defined specific clear event
condition
epoch event epoch criteria period era age characterized
examples
calendar era starts arbitrary epoch
chosen commemorate important historical mythological event
epoch anno domini calendar era
civil calendar era internationally countries
incarnation jesus
current historical calendar eras exist
epoch
astronomy
epoch specific moment time celestial coordinates orbital elements
orbital parametrics calculated order predict future position
applied tools mathematics disciplines celestial mechanics subfield orbital mechanics
predict orbital paths positions
center gravity generate ephemeris
plural
ephemerides
greek word ephemeros daily
table values positions astronomical objects sky time times
formula calculate proper time offset epoch
calculations generally result elliptical path plane defined point orbit
foci ellipse
viewing orbiting body
trace orbit
creates shifts dimensions spherical trigonometry calculate relative positions
interestingly
dynamics dimensions elliptical
means ephemeris set equations predictive tool predict future location object interest
time
inexactitudes errors accumulate
creating greater errors prediction
ephemeris factors recalculated time time
requires epoch defined
astronomers groups astronomers define epochs suit
days speedy communications
epochs generally defined international agreement
astronomers world wide collaborate effectively
inefficient error prone data observed group translation
mathematic transformation
groups compare information
