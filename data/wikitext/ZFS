major feature distinguishes zfs file systems zfs designed ground focus data integrity
designed protect user data disk silent data corruption caused bit rot

ghost writes
data integrity high priority zfs recent research shows widespread file ufs
ext
xfs
jfs
hardware raid provide sufficient protection problems
hardware raid issues data integrity
initial research zfs protects data earlier solutions
faster ufs dragonfly bsd hammer file system
successor ufs
modern hard disk devotes large portion capacity error detection data
errors occur normal usage
corrected disk internal software
visible host software
tiny fraction detected errors correctable
modern enterprise sas disk specification estimates fraction uncorrected error bits
modern enterprise fibre channel disk byte sectors support dif data integrity field standard combat data corruption
reports similar error rates
worst type errors unnoticed
detected disk firmware host operating system
silent corruption
real life study
million hdds netapp database found average sata drives silent corruption caught hardware raid verification process
raid system works undetected error data read
external error sources disk
instance
disk cable slightly loose
power supply flaky
external vibrations loud sound
fibre channel switch faulty
cosmic radiation types soft errors
storage systems analyzed
firmware bugs accounted storage failures
error rates observed cern study silent corruption
higher bits
webshop amazon
confirms high data corruption rates
silent data corruption concern storage devices remained small slow
user rarely faced silent corruption
deemed problem required solution
advent larger drives fast raid setups
user capable transferring bits short time
zfs creator jeff bonwick stated fast database greenplum database software company located san mateo
california specializing enterprise data cloud solutions large scale data warehousing analytics faces silent corruption minutes
reasons greenplum base fast database solution zfs
large fast raid setups require file systems focus data integrity
design goals zfs
explained jeff bonwick

zfs heal data storage pool redundancy zfs mirroring raid
storage pool consists single disk provide redundancy
means data stored
thrice

storage capacity disk
redundancy exists
zfs fetches copy data
recreates raid recovery mechanism
recalculates reproducing original time
data pass integrity check
system update copy good data redundancy restored
zfs fully protect user data hardware raid controller
perform automatic healing controls redundancy disks data
zfs prefers direct
exclusive access disks

user insists hardware level raid
controller configured jbod mode
turn raid functionality
zfs guarantee data integrity
note hardware raid configured jbod detach disks respond time
require tler

raid controller generally called host bus adapter

zfs layers disk cache speed read write operations
ideally
