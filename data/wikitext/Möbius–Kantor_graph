Möbius–Kantor graph

graph
mathematical field graph theory
graph symmetric bipartite cubic graph vertices edges named august ferdinand seligmann kantor
defined generalized petersen graph
formed vertices octagon
connected vertices point star point star connected points steps
asked exists pair polygons sides
property vertices polygon lie lines edges polygon
vice versa
vertices edges polygons form projective configuration
solution euclidean plane
kantor
found pairs polygons type
generalization problem points edges belong complex projective plane
kantor solution
coordinates polygon vertices complex numbers
kantor solution
pair mutually inscribed quadrilaterals complex projective plane
called configuration
graph derives levi graph configuration
vertex point vertex triple
edge connecting vertices correspond point triple point
graph subgraph dimensional hypercube graph
formed removing edges hypercube
