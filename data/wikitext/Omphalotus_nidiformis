ghost fungus initially english naturalist miles joseph berkeley agaricus nidiformis

grevillea drummondii named agaricus lampas berkeley
noted phosphorescent closely related species
tasmanian botanist ronald campbell gunn collected material october state
berkeley felt differed previous collections demarcated decurrent gills shorter stipe
named agaricus phosphorus

miller notes colours shades ghost fungus closely resemble species
laboratory breeding experiments omphalotus species revealed low level compatibility
ability breed produce fertile hybrids
suggesting genetically distinct isolated long time
poorly compatible
authors study suggesting separation long ago late carboniferous separation gondwana laurasia conceding lack fossil record makes impossible genus existed time
