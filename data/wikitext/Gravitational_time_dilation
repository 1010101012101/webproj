Gravitational time dilation

gravitational time dilation
gravitational time dilation effect time passing rates regions gravitational potential
lower gravitational potential
closer clock source gravitation
slowly time passes
albert einstein originally predicted effect theory relativity confirmed tests general relativity
demonstrated noting atomic clocks differing altitudes
gravitational potential
eventually show times
effects detected experiments extremely small
differences measured nanoseconds
gravitational time dilation albert einstein consequence special relativity accelerated frames reference
general relativity
considered difference passage proper time positions metric tensor spacetime
existence gravitational time dilation confirmed directly experiment
clocks massive bodies
higher gravitational potentials
run faster
clocks close massive bodies
lower gravitational potentials
run slower
