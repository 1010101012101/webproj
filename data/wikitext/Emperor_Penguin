dorsal side head black sharply delineated white belly
pale yellow breast bright yellow ear patches
penguins flightless
streamlined body
wings stiffened flattened flippers marine habitat
diet consists primarily fish
include crustaceans

hunting
species remain submerged
diving depth
adaptations facilitate
including unusually structured hemoglobin function low oxygen levels
solid bones reduce barotrauma
ability reduce metabolism shut essential organ functions
emperor penguin sequence journeys adults make year order mate feed offspring
penguin species breeds antarctic winter
treks
ice breeding colonies include thousands individuals
female lays single egg
incubated male female returns sea feed
parents subsequently turns foraging sea caring chick colony
lifespan typically wild

emperor penguin agitated body temperature metabolic rate rise increase heat loss
raising wings exposing undersides increases exposure body surface air
facilitating heat loss

eliminates risk mechanical barotrauma
diving
emperor penguin oxygen markedly reduced
heart rate reduced low beats minute essential organs shut
facilitating longer dives
