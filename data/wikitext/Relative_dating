Relative dating

relative dating
relative dating science determining relative order past events
necessarily determining absolute age
geology rock superficial deposits
fossils lithologies correlate stratigraphic column
prior discovery radiometric dating provided means absolute dating early century
archaeologists geologists largely limited relative dating techniques determine geological events
relative dating determine sequential order series events occurred

principle intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions
geology
igneous intrusion cuts formation sedimentary rock
determined igneous intrusion younger sedimentary rock
number types intrusions
including stocks
laccoliths
batholiths
sills dikes
principle cross cutting relationships pertains formation faults age sequences cut
faults younger rocks cut
fault found penetrates formations top
formations cut older fault
cut younger fault
finding key bed situations determine fault normal fault thrust fault
principle inclusions components states

inclusions
clasts
found formation
inclusions older formation
sedimentary rocks
common gravel older formation ripped included newer layer
similar situation igneous rocks occurs xenoliths found
foreign bodies picked magma lava flows
incorporated
cool matrix
result
xenoliths older rock
principle original horizontality states deposition sediments occurs essentially horizontal beds
observation modern marine marine sediments wide variety environments supports generalization
cross bedding inclined
orientation cross bedded units horizontal
law superposition states sedimentary rock layer tectonically undisturbed sequence younger beneath older
logically younger layer slip beneath layer previously deposited
principle sedimentary layers viewed form vertical time line
partial complete record time elapsed deposition lowest layer deposition highest bed

principles succession developed independently evolutionary thought
principle complex
uncertainties fossilization
localization fossil types due lateral habitat
facies change sedimentary strata
fossils found globally time
principle lateral continuity states layers sediment initially extend laterally directions
words
laterally continuous
result
rocks similar
separated valley erosional feature
assumed originally continuous
layers sediment extend indefinitely
limits recognized controlled amount type sediment size shape sedimentary basin
long sediment transported area
eventually deposited
amount material lessens source
layer material thinner
coarser grained material longer transported area transporting medium insufficient energy carry location

planetary scientists decipher development bodies solar system
vast majority cases surface samples
principles applied
valley formed inside impact crater
valley younger crater
craters highly relative dating
general rule
younger planetary surface
fewer craters
long term cratering rates precision
crude absolute dates applied based craters
cratering rates earth moon system poorly
