Necrotizing fasciitis

necrotizing fasciitis
necrotizing fasciitis
commonly flesh eating disease flesh eating bacteria syndrome
rare infection deeper layers skin subcutaneous tissues
easily spreading fascial plane subcutaneous tissue
necrotizing fasciitis quickly progressing
greater risk developing immunocompromised due conditions diabetes
cancer
severe disease sudden onset treated immediately high doses intravenous antibiotics
type describes polymicrobial infection
type describes monomicrobial infection
types bacteria necrotizing fasciitis
group streptococcus
streptococcus pyogenes
staphylococcus aureus
clostridium perfringens
bacteroides fragilis
aeromonas hydrophila
infections occur people compromised immune systems
historically
group streptococcus made cases type infections
early
form monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis observed increasing frequency
caused methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus
mrsa
published case reports implied link steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
evidence link weak small number case patients unclear drugs masked symptoms secondary infection
cases recorded patients clinical situations
immunosuppression
diabetes
alcoholism
drug abuse
smoking
malignancies
chronic systemic diseases
occasionally occurs people apparently normal general condition
infection begins locally site trauma

minor
apparent
patients complain intense pain excessive external appearance skin
progression disease
hours
tissue swollen
diarrhea vomiting common symptoms
early stages
signs inflammation apparent bacteria deep tissue
deep
signs inflammation
redness swollen hot skin
develop quickly
skin color progress violet
blisters form
subsequent necrosis
death
subcutaneous tissues
patients necrotizing fasciitis typically fever
mortality rates noted high percent left untreated
surgery medical assistance
antibiotics
infection rapidly progress eventually lead death
flesh eating bacteria
misnomer
bacteria
eat
tissue
destruction skin muscle releasing toxins
virulence factors
include streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins
streptococcus pyogenes produces exotoxin superantigen
toxin capable activating cells specifically
overproduction cytokines severe systemic illness
toxic shock syndrome
laboratory risk indicator necrotizing fasciitis
lrinec
score utilized risk stratify patients presenting signs cellulitis determine likelihood necrotizing fasciitis present
serologic measures
reactive protein
total white blood cell count
hemoglobin
sodium
creatinine glucose
score greater necrotizing fasciitis considered
scoring criteria
patients typically surgery based high index suspicion
determined patient signs symptoms
necrotizing fasciitis
aggressive surgical debridement
removal infected tissue
spreading treatment
diagnosis confirmed visual examination tissues tissue samples microscopic evaluation
early medical treatment presumptive
antibiotics started condition suspected
initial treatment includes combination intravenous antibiotics including piperacillin
tazobactam
vancomycin
clindamycin
cultures determine antibiotic coverage
antibiotics changed culture results obtained
maladies characterized massive wounds tissue destruction
hyperbaric oxygen treatment valuable adjunctive therapy widely
amputation affected limb
repeat explorations remove additional necrotic tissue
typically
leaves large open wound
requires skin grafting
necrosis internal
thoracic abdominal
viscera intestinal tissue
systemic inflammatory response profound
patients require monitoring intensive care unit
extreme nature wounds grafting debridement accompanies treatment
burn center wound clinic
staff trained wounds
utilized
treatment necrotizing fasciitis involve interdisciplinary care team
case necrotizing fasciitis involving head neck
team include otolaryngologists
speech pathologists
intensivists
microbiologists plastic surgeons oral maxillofacial surgeons
