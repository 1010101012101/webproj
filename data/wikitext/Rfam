Rfam

rfam
rfam database information coding rna
ncrna
families structured rna elements
annotated
open access database hosted wellcome trust sanger institute collaboration janelia farm
rfam designed similar pfam database annotating protein families
unlike proteins
ncrnas similar secondary structure sharing similarity primary sequence
rfam divides ncrnas families based evolution common ancestor
producing multiple sequence alignments
msa
families provide insight structure function
similar case protein families
msas addition secondary structure information
rfam researchers contribute rna wikiproject
rfam database variety functions
ncrna family

alignment
hand curated alignment representative members ncrna family annotated structural information
seed alignment create scfg
rfam software infernal identify additional family members add alignment
family specific threshold chosen avoid false positives
performing rfam searches profile scfg computationally expensive
small ncrna family takes unreasonable amount time computer search
reduce search time
initial blast search reduce search space manageable size
msa alignment
created result search covariance model sequence database
detected homologs aligned model
giving automatically produced full alignment
version
