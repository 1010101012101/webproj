provider offer bandwidth pooling bandwidth
rest bandwidth practically unusable
fact commonly hosting providers
hosting providers cut costs offering amount bandwidth frequently
overselling
high bandwidth customers host offer
balanced customers maximum allowed
reasons choosing outsource dedicated servers availability high powered networks multiple providers
dedicated server providers utilize massive amounts bandwidth
secure lower volume based pricing include multi provider blend bandwidth
achieve type network multi provider blend bandwidth
large investment core routers
