Equations for a falling body

equations falling body
set dynamical equations describe resultant trajectories objects move owing constant gravitational force normal earth bound conditions
newton law universal gravitation simplifies
mass body
assumption reasonable objects falling earth short vertical distances everyday experience
untrue larger distances
spacecraft trajectories
note article resistance air
drag
neglected
equations ignore air resistance
dramatic effect objects falling appreciable distance air
causing quickly approach terminal velocity
effect air resistance varies enormously depending size geometry falling object
equations hopelessly wrong feather
low mass offers large resistance air
absence atmosphere objects fall rate
astronaut david scott demonstrated dropping hammer feather surface moon
equations ignore rotation earth
failing describe coriolis effect
accurate dense compact objects falling heights exceeding tallest man made structures

cases
body assumed start rest
air resistance neglected
generally
earth atmosphere
means results inaccurate seconds fall
time object velocity vacuum
due air resistance
body travelling atmosphere perfect vacuum encounter drag force induced air resistance
drag force increases velocity
object reach state drag force equals gravitational force point acceleration object
object falls constant velocity
state called terminal velocity
drag force dependant density atmosphere
coefficient drag object
