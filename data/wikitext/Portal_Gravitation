mathematical formulation gravity published sir isaac newton
law universal gravitation standard theory gravity work albert einstein general relativity
calculations general relativity complicated
newtonian gravity sufficiently accurate applications
dealing weak gravitational fields
launching rockets
projectiles
swinging pendulums
newton formulas generally preferred
steven weinberg noted build suspension bridge newton laws
newton theory simpler mathematical structure general relativity
newton laws generally taught high school level general relativity taught students opting physics undergraduate graduate courses
quantum gravity attempt unify theories gravitation quantum mechanics consistent manner
precisely
formulate consistent theory reduces ordinary quantum mechanics limit weak gravity
potentials
reduces einsteinian general relativity limit large actions
newton conceived gravitation considered trajectory projectile
projectile influence gravity travels trajectory conic section
projectile elliptical path hyperbolic path
depending total mechanical energy greater escape velocity
pathological case projectile total mechanic energy equal escape velocity
projectile parabolic trajectory
low speeds small distances
small surface earth considered flat
elliptical trajectory projectile easily approximated parabolic trajectory
newton heard sound apple falling ground
asked
called gravitation
motion apple
explain motion moon
statement universal law gravitation
strictly speaking
law applies point objects
objects spatial extent
true force found integrating forces points
law expressed equation
gravitational equation similar coulomb law deals electrostatic force charged particles
einstein theory general relativity
stated presence mass
energy
momentum spacetime curved
curvature
paths objects inertial motion follow
deviate
change direction time
deviation appears acceleration massive objects
newton characterized gravity
general relativity
acceleration free fall inertial motion
objects gravitational field fall rate due inertial motion observer accelerated
identification free fall inertia equivalence principle
