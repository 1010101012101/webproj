dimensional
commonly depict geography
maps represent space
real imagined
regard context scale
brain mapping
dna mapping
extraterrestrial mapping
cartography map making study practice crafting representations earth flat surface
history cartography
makes maps called cartographer
road maps widely maps today
form subset navigational maps
include aeronautical nautical charts
railroad network maps
hiking bicycling maps
terms quantity
largest number drawn map sheets made local surveys
carried municipalities
utilities
tax assessors
emergency services providers
local agencies
national surveying projects carried military
british ordnance survey
civilian government agency internationally renowned comprehensively detailed work
addition location information maps portray contour lines indicating constant values elevation
temperature
rainfall
orientation map relationship directions map compass directions reality
word
orient
derived latin oriens
meaning east
middle ages maps
including maps
drawn east top
meaning direction
map corresponds east compass
today
common universal cartographic convention north top map
kinds maps traditionally oriented north top
maps drawn scale
expressed ratio
meaning unit measurement map corresponds
approximately
unit ground
scale statement exact region mapped small curvature earth neglected
town planner city map
larger regions curvature map projections curved surface earth
sphere ellipsoid
plane
impossibility flattening sphere plane implies map projection constant scale
projections achieve accurate scale lines
necessarily straight
projection
map projections introduce concept point scale
function position
strive variation narrow bounds
scale statement nominal accurate precise measurements
large scale maps
cover small regions great detail small scale maps
cover large regions nations
continents globe
large
small terminology arose practice writing scales numerical fractions
larger
exact dividing line large small
considered medium scale
examples large scale maps
maps produced hikers
hand maps intended motorists
small scale
important recognise accurate maps sacrifice amount accuracy scale deliver greater visual usefulness user
width roads small streams exaggerated narrow shown map true scale
printed map narrower perceived naked eye
applies computer maps smallest unit pixel
narrow stream shown width pixel map scale small fraction pixel width
maps
called cartograms
scale deliberately distorted reflect information land area distance
map europe distorted show population distribution
rough shape continent discernable
distorted scale famous london underground map
basic geographical structure respected tube lines
river thames
smoothed clarify relationships stations
center map stations spaced edges map
inaccuracies deliberate
cartographers simply omit military installations remove features solely order enhance clarity map
road map show railroads
smaller waterways prominent road objects
show
dashed dotted lines
outlines
main roads
decluttering
practice makes subject matter user interested easier read
sacrificing accuracy
software based maps user toggle decluttering
auto needed
auto degree decluttering adjusted user scale displayed

railroads buildings
topographic maps show elevations relief contour lines shading
geological maps show physical surface
characteristics underlying rock

subsurface structures
maps depict surface earth projection
translating dimensional real surface geoid dimensional picture
world map projection mercator projection
