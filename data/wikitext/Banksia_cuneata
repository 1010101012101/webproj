firstly
higher density disturbed populations leads greater rates mating neighbouring plants
resulting genetic structure effective selfing
disturbed populations lack understorey
support resident population honeyeaters
rely occasional visitors pollination
greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations average

model based investigation found optimal fire interval maximising population size medium term years
frequent fires reduce population size killing adults reached full fecundity
frequent fires reduce population size fewer opportunities seed dispersal germination
optimal fire interval minimising risk extinct long term longer
