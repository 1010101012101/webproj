Geode

geode
geodes
greek
earthlike
geological secondary structures occur sedimentary volcanic rocks
geodes essentially hollow spherical oblate masses mineral matter form filling vesicles
gas bubbles
volcanic volcanic rocks minerals deposited hydrothermal fluids
dissolution sedimentary concretions
deposited syngenetically rock formations found
partial filling minerals precipitated diagenetic hydrothermal fluids
geodes differ vugs formed early
rounded
structures surrounding rock
vugs irregular voids cavities cross cutting formation
vein breccia
geodes differ
nodules
nodule mass mineral matter accreted nodule nucleus
structures minerals contained
deposited groundwater hydrothermal processes
geodes commonly chalcedony
cryptocrystalline quartz
shell lined internally minerals
