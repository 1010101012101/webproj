primary function web server deliver web pages request clients hypertext transfer protocol
means delivery html documents additional content included document
images
style sheets scripts
user agent
commonly web browser web crawler
initiates communication making request specific resource server responds content resource error message unable
resource typically real file server secondary storage
necessarily case depends web server implemented
primary function serve content
full implementation includes ways receiving content clients
feature submitting web forms
including uploading files
generic web servers support server side scripting active server pages
asp
php
scripting languages
means behaviour web server scripted separate files
actual server software remains unchanged
function create html documents dynamically
fly
opposed returning static documents
primarily retrieving
modifying information databases
typically faster easily cached
web servers serving world wide web
found embedded devices printers
routers
webcams serving local network
web server part system monitoring
administering device question
means additional software installed client computer
web browser required
included operating systems

response describe content file file error message return file exist unavailable
web server implemented kernel
user space
regular applications
kernel web server
tux gnu
linux microsoft iis windows
work faster
part system
directly hardware resources
paged memory
cpu time slices
network adapters
buffers
web servers run user mode system permission memory cpu resources
requests kernel time
satisfied system reserves resources usage responsibility share hardware resources running applications
applications access system internal buffers
useless buffer copies create handicap user mode web servers
consequence
user mode web server match kernel mode performance raise quality code higher standards
similar code web servers run kernel
significant issue windows
user mode overhead times greater linux
web server
