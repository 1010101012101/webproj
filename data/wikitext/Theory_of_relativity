explanations
special relativity published
final form general relativity published
special relativity applies elementary particles interactions
general relativity applies cosmological astrophysical realm
including astronomy
special relativity widely accepted physics community
theory rapidly significant tool theorists experimentalists fields atomic physics
nuclear physics

conversely
general relativity
appeared applicability experimentalists applications astronomical scales
limited making minor corrections predictions newtonian gravitation theory
finally
mathematics general relativity appeared difficult
thought small number people world
time
fully understand theory detail
discredited richard feynman
critical resurgence interest occurred resulted making general relativity central physics astronomy
mathematical techniques applicable study general relativity substantially streamlined calculations
physically discernible concepts isolated mathematical complexity
discovery exotic astronomical phenomena general relativity crucially relevant
helped catalyze resurgence
astronomical phenomena included quasars
kelvin microwave background radiation
pulsars
discovery black hole candidates
einstein stated theory relativity belongs class
principle theories
employs analytic method
means elements comprise theory based hypothesis empirical discovery
empirical discovery leads understanding general characteristics natural processes
mathematical models developed separate natural processes theoretical mathematical descriptions
analytical means conditions satisfied deduced
separate events satisfy conditions
experience match conclusions
