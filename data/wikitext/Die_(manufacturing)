entrance angle guides wire die
approach angle
brings wire nib
facilitates reduction
bearing back relief
lubrication added entrance angle
lube powdered soap form
lubricant soap
friction drawing wire heats soap liquid form coats wire
wire contact die
thin coat lubricant prevent metal metal contact
pulling substantial rod fine wire series dies obtain progressive reduction diameter stages
standard wire gauges refer number dies wire pulled
higher numbered wire gauge meant thinner wire
typical telephone wires gauge
main power cables gauge
