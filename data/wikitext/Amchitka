agenda fight blast island
expand efforts fight perceived threats environment
leaving
man gave traditional farewell peace activist movement
peace

committee referred predictions made vancouver journalist named bob hunter
greenpeace member
wrote test earthquakes tsunami
aec considered likelihood test triggering severe earthquake
imminent nearby fault
considered tsunami
disagreed
russell train

argued
experience milrow
provide basis extrapolation
highly nonlinear phenomena involved earthquake generation
threshold strain exceeded prior initiation large earthquake
underground explosion serve domino row dominoes leading major earthquake
case earthquakes time assess quantitatively probability tsunami explosion

aec withdrew island
scientists continue visit island monitoring purposes
doe returned site remove environmental contamination
drilling mud pits stabilized mixing clean soil

concerns expressed fissures opening underground
allowing radioactive materials leak ocean
greenpeace study found cannikin leaking plutonium americium environment
scientific divers university alaska fairbanks collected shallow subtidal organisms reported
indications radioactive leakage
wonderful news
