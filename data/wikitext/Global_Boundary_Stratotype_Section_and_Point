Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point

global boundary stratotype section point
global boundary stratotype section point
abbreviated gssp
internationally agreed stratigraphic section serves reference section boundary geologic time scale
effort define gssps conducted international commission stratigraphy
part international union geological sciences
gssps based paleontological
gssps terms transitions faunal stages
faunal stages gssps
gssp definition effort commenced
stages gssp formally defined
geologic section fulfill set criteria adapted gssp ics
list summarizes criteria
precambrian cambrian boundary gssp fortune head
newfoundland typical gssp
accessible paved road set nature preserve
continuous section beds precambrian beds cambrian
boundary set appearance complex trace fossil treptichnus pedum found worldwide
fortune head gssp washed built
nonetheless
treptichnus pedum ideal marker fossil found cambrian sequence
assured found level exposure
fact
eroding boundary marker
identified strata gssp
fossil preferable
radiometrically datable bed boundary fortune head
slightly boundary similar beds nearby
factors led geologists suggest gssp assigning
gssp boundary agreed
golden spike
driven geologic section mark precise boundary future geologists
practice
spike
golden actual spike
stratigraphic boundary defined identifying silurian devonian boundary bronze plaque locality called klonk
northeast village suchomasty czech republic
gssps referred golden spikes
defining gssp depends finding preserved geologic sections identifying key events
task difficult farther back time
million years ago
boundaries geologic timescale defined simply reference fixed dates
global standard stratigraphic ages
