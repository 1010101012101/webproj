Late Cretaceous

late cretaceous
late cretaceous
younger epochs cretaceous period divided geologic timescale
rock strata epoch form upper cretaceous series
cretaceous named white limestone chalk occurs widely northern france famously white cliffs south eastern england
dates time
late cretaceous
climate warmer present
period cooling trend evident
tropics restricted equatorial regions northern latitudes experienced markedly seasonal climatic conditions
due plate tectonics
americas gradually moving westward
causing atlantic ocean expand
western interior seaway divided north america eastern western halves
appalachia laramidia
india maintained northward asia
southern hemisphere
australia antarctica remained connected began drift africa south america
europe island chain
populating islands endemic dwarf dinosaur species
period great success dinosaurs
types appearing diversifying
citation needed duck bills
ankylosauridae
horned dinosaurs experienced success asiamerica
western north america eastern asia
tyrannosaurs dominated large predator niche north america
present asia
smaller primitive north american varieties
pachycephalosaurs present north america asia
dromaeosaurs shared geographical distribution
documented mongolia western north america
contrast therizinosaurs
previously segnosaurs
living solely asia
gondwanaland held dinosaurian fauna
predators abelisaurs titanosaurs dominant herbivores
birds increasingly common diverse
replacing pterosaurs retreated increasingly specialised ecological niches
didelphid marsupials primitive placental mammals common
mammals remained small
seas
mosasaurs suddenly appeared underwent spectacular evolutionary radiation
modern sharks appeared giant penguin polycotylid plesiosaurs

predators fed numerous teleost fishes
turn evolved advanced modern forms

geological events reduced sunlight hindered photosynthesis
leading massive disruption earth ecology
researchers extinction gradual
resulting slower sea level climate
