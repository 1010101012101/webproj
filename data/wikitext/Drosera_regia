evolutionary model

rapid leaf tentacle movement
model proposes plant carnivory snap trap evolved flypaper traps drosera
driven increasing prey size
larger prey easily escape sticky mucilage flypaper traps
evolution snap traps largely prevent escape kleptoparasitism
theft prey captured plant derive benefit

author
edith layard stephens
reported successful cultivation
noting success required
moist comparatively cool atmosphere
similar native environment
difficult species cultivate
modern reports cultivation conditions led success
optimal growth
appears require good soil drainage sufficient light levels
prefers cooler temperatures
cool nights warm days reported induce vigorous growth
asexual propagation frequently achieved small root cuttings leaf cuttings
tend rot roots form
seed germination occurs early days weeks fresh seed
faster drosera species
germination phanerocotylar
glandular cotyledons exposed
free seed coverings
true leaves alternate arrangement
