sufficiently distinct separate subfamily
pseudochelidoninae
member subfamily white eyed river martin pseudochelidon sirintarae
site thailand possibly extinct
species possess number features distinguish swallows martins
including robust legs feet
stout bills
large syrinxes

bronchial structure
genetic studies confirmed river martins form distinct clade typical swallows hirundininae subfamily
river martins ways intermediate typical swallows passerines
arrangement leg muscles typical passerine swallow
extent differences swallows wide geographical separation martins suggest relict populations group species diverged main swallow lineage early evolutionary history
early hirundine lineages
martins nest excavated burrows
adopted nest holes mud nests
physical characteristics breeding behaviour suggest primitive swallows
