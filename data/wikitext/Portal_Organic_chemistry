silicon sulfur
original definition
organic
chemistry misconception organic compounds related life processes
organic compounds support life earth
life depends heavily inorganic chemistry
enzymes rely transition metals iron copper
materials shells
teeth bones part organic
part inorganic composition
elemental carbon
inorganic chemistry deals simple carbon compounds
molecular structures carbon carbon connections
oxides
acids
carbonates
carbides
minerals
single carbon organic compounds exist
methane simple derivatives
biochemistry deals chemistry proteins
large biomolecules
unique properties
multi carbon compounds exhibit extremely large variety range application organic compounds enormous
form basis
important constituents products
paints
plastics
food
explosives
drugs
petrochemicals
exceptions
form basis earthly life processes
shapes chemical reactivities organic molecules provide astonishing variety functions
enzyme catalysts biochemical reactions live systems
autopropagating nature organic chemicals life

aldol reaction important carbon carbon bond formation reaction organic chemistry
usual form
involves nucleophilic addition ketone enolate aldehyde form hydroxy ketone
aldol
aldehyde alcohol
structural unit found naturally occurring molecules pharmaceuticals
aldol addition product loses molecule water reaction form
unsaturated ketone
called aldol condensation
aldol reaction discovered independently charles adolphe wurtz alexander porfyrevich borodin
borodin observed aldol dimerization hydroxybutanal acetaldehyde acidic conditions
aldol reaction widely large scale production commodity chemicals pentaerythritol pharmaceutical industry synthesis optically pure drugs
pfizer initial route heart disease drug lipitor
inn
atorvastatin
approved
employed aldol reactions
allowing access multigram scale quantities drug
aldol structural motif common polyketides
class natural products pharmaceuticals derived
including potent immunosuppressant
tetracycline antibiotics
antifungal agent amphotericin
extensive research aldol reaction produced highly efficient methods enable challenging synthesis polyketides laboratory
paclitaxel important drug treatment cancer
complex structure provided challenging target total synthesis nicolaou group
colors approach
wittig reaction chemical reaction aldehyde ketone triphenyl phosphonium ylide
called wittig reagent
give alkene triphenylphosphine oxide
wittig reaction discovered georg wittig
awarded nobel prize chemistry
widely organic synthesis preparation alkenes
confused wittig rearrangement
wittig reactions commonly couple aldehydes ketones singly substituted phosphine ylides
simple ylides results exclusively alkene product
order obtain alkene
schlosser modification wittig reaction performed
