Underground nuclear testing

underground nuclear testing
underground nuclear testing refers test detonations nuclear weapons performed underground
device tested buried sufficient depth
explosion contained
release radioactive materials atmosphere
extreme heat pressure underground nuclear explosion surrounding rock
rock closest location test vaporised
forming cavity
zones crushed
cracked
irreversibly strained rock
explosion
rock cavity collapse
forming rubble chimney
chimney reaches surface
bowl shaped subsidence crater form
underground test place
tests provided information eventually led signing limited test ban treaty
banned nuclear tests performed underground
signing comprehensive test ban treaty
nuclear tests performed underground
order prevent nuclear fallout entering atmosphere
public concern fallout nuclear testing grew early
