common banksia species
observations populations showed plants produced seed years age
leading recommendation years fires seed banks accumulate
fire occurs frequently
plants burned reaching maturity produced sufficient seed ensure regeneration population
population decline local extinction
long time fires population decline
plants die natural attrition releasing seed
resulting seed wastage
banksia verticillata declared vulnerable federal environment protection biodiversity conservation act
rare western australia wildlife conservation act
census yielded estimated total population size plants
dieback aerial canker
frequency bushfires illegal picking cited threats
ongoing management includes monitoring current populations

germination rates ten years storage lower banksia brownii
translocation considered option future
spraying phosphite
vicinity walpole
successfully
untrialled
phosphite boosts resistance infected uninfected plants
acts direct fungicide
aerial spraying phosphite boosts plant survival slows spread infection
carefully managed studies shown foliar spraying phosphite adversely affects root shoot growth
banksia verticillata seldom cultivation
natural growing conditions point sunny aspect good drainage important cultivation
good coastal situations erosion control
