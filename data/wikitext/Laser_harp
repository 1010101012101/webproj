approaches
possibilities doubt exist
possibilities poses challenges costs
inexpensive straightforward implement
microcontroller drives lasers reads detectors
advantage dedicated sensor mechanism instrument contained
opposed requiring computer control ilda interface usb camera
hand
based approach offers flexibility constructed shelf hardware
unframed laser harps benefit higher power lasers
facilitate easier detection sensor system
sensor exposed ambient light
swamped stage lighting artist sensitivity high
avoid problem
ambient light sensors reject ambient light laser light sensors
white light coloured
gloves improves instrument performance allowing light scatter player hands provide sensor higher signal noise ratio respect ambient light
gloves protect player skin potentially hazardous laser radiation give audiences visual impression instrument played
