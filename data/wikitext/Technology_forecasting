Technology forecasting

technology forecasting
technology forecasting attempts predict future characteristics technological machines
procedures techniques
primarily
technological forecast deals characteristics technology
levels technical performance
speed military aircraft
power watts future engine
accuracy precision measuring instrument
number transistors chip year
forecast state characteristics achieved
technological forecasting deals machines
procedures techniques
exclude domain technological forecasting commodities
services techniques intended luxury amusement
purpose recitation alternatives
show alternative forecasting
decisionmaker alternatives open
choose basis desirable outcome
decision inevitably based forecast
choice forecast obtained rational explicit methods
intuitive means
virtues rational methods
virtue explicit methods reviewed
checked consistency
forecast reviewed subsequent time
technology forecasting imagination
commonly adopted methods technology forecasting include delphi method
forecast analogy
growth curves extrapolation
normative methods technology forecasting relevance trees
morphological models
mission flow diagrams commonly
delphi method
delphi method structured communication technique
originally developed systematic
interactive forecasting method relies panel experts
standard version
experts answer questionnaires rounds
round
facilitator anonymous summary forecasts previous round reasons provided judgments
experts encouraged revise earlier answers light replies members panel
believed process range answers decrease group converge
correct
answer
finally
process stopped pre defined stop criterion
number rounds
achievement consensus
stability results
median scores final rounds determine results
studies past forecasts shown frequent reasons forecast wrong forecaster ignores related fields
technical approach fail achieve level capability forecast
superseded technical approach forecaster
problem inconsistency forecasts
problems
combine forecasts technologies
select method
combine forecasts obtained methods
strengths method compensate weaknesses
primary reason combining forecasts technology attempt offset weaknesses forecasting method strengths
addition
forecasting method forecaster insight processes work responsible growth technology forecast
frequently combination growth curves trend curve technology
succession growth curves
describing level functional capability achieved specific technical approach
trend curve shown
fitted items historical data represent superior approach
growth curves trend curve combination forecaster draw conclusions future growth technology
method
growth curves
forecaster time technical approach supplanted successor approach
trend curve
forecaster ability specific technical approach meet projected trend
successor approach
combining forecasts
frequently combination forecasts trend curve analogies
customarily scatter data points trend curve due random influences control measure
consistent deviations represent random influences
consistent deviations identified
opportunity apply analogy
typical events bring deviations trend wars depressions
purpose combining analogies trend forecast predict deviations trend deviations caused external events influences
analogy
important determine extent analogy event basis forecast
historical model event
satisfies criteria valid analogy
combining forecasts technologies important combining forecasts technology
reason fact technologies interact interrelated fashion
reason consistency picture scenario
simplest examples interacting trends projection absurdity
simply projecting data indefinitely specific result
instance
simply projects recent rates growth world population
arrives fantastic conclusions density population place dates millennium
trends confidently expected continue indefinitely
instance interacting trends case number scientists
growing faster population
science activity united states grew exponentially
number dollars spent growing faster gnp
projected indefinitely
curves give result eventually person
working scientist entire gnp devoted
absurd conclusions
clear scientific discipline technology forecasting mere trend extrapolation involves combining forecasts
modern manufacturing firms utilize services technological forecaster
number alternatives rational explicit forecasting technology
forecast
happen
relying pure chance
window blind forecasting
genius forecasting boasting glorious past
adopting techniques
technological forecasting mere astrology palmistry
scientific defined procedure adopted technological forecaster consultancy forecasting technology
technological forecasting scientific discipline
