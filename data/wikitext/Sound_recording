acoustic analog recording achieved small microphone diaphragm detect atmospheric pressure
acoustic sound waves
record graphic representation sound waves medium phonograph
stylus senses grooves record
magnetic tape recording
sound waves vibrate microphone diaphragm converted varying electric current
converted varying magnetic field electromagnet
makes representation sound magnetized areas plastic tape magnetic coating
analog sound reproduction reverse process
bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing atmospheric pressure form acoustic sound waves
electronically generated sound waves recorded directly devices electric guitar pickup synthesizer
acoustics recording process musicians hear playing recording sessions
digital recording reproduction converts analog sound signal picked microphone digital form process digitization
allowing stored transmitted wider variety media
digital recording stores audio series binary numbers representing samples amplitude audio signal equal time intervals
sample rate high convey sounds capable heard
digital recordings considered higher quality analog recordings necessarily higher fidelity
wider frequency response dynamic range
digital format prevent loss quality found analog recording due noise electromagnetic interference playback
mechanical deterioration damage storage medium
digital audio signal reconverted analog form playback applied loudspeaker earphones
long sound recorded
