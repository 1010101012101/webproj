Tephrochronology

tephrochronology
tephrochronology geochronological technique discrete layers ash single create chronological framework paleoenvironmental archaeological records
established event
tephra horizon
premise technique volcanic event produces ash unique chemical
fingerprint
deposit identified area affected fallout
volcanic event independently dated
tephra horizon act time marker
main advantages technique volcanic ash layers easily identified sediments tephra layers deposited instantaneously wide spatial area
means provide accurate temporal marker layers verify corroborate dating techniques
linking sequences widely separated location unified chronology correlates climatic sequences events
tephrochronology requires accurate geochemical fingerprinting
