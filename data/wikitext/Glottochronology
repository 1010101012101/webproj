glottochronology refers
original method presumed core vocabulary language replaced constant
constant average
rate languages cultures
measure passage time
process makes list lexical terms
lists compiled morris swadesh assumed resistant borrowing
originally designed list items
refined word list swadesh
common modern day linguists
core vocabulary designed encompass concepts common human language
personal pronouns
body parts
heavenly bodies
verbs basic actions
numerals
eliminating concepts specific culture time
found ideal fact meaning set tailored languages compared
alternative word lists compiled linguists
fewer meaning slots
percentage cognates
words common origin
word lists measured
larger percentage cognates
recently languages compared presumed separated

proposed
resulting formula
taking account time dependence individual stability quotients
formula
reflects gradual slowing replacement process due individual rates
stable elements quickest replaced
square root represents reverse trend acceleration replacement items original wordlist
