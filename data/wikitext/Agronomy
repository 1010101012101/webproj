agronomists today involved issues including producing food
creating healthier food
managing environmental impact agriculture
creating energy plants
agronomists specialize areas crop rotation
irrigation drainage
plant breeding
plant physiology
soil classification
soil fertility
weed control
insect pest control
area agronomy involves selective breeding plants produce crops conditions
plant breeding increased crop yields improved nutritional numerous crops
including corn
soybeans
wheat
led development types plants
hybrid grain called triticale produced crossbreeding rye wheat
triticale usable protein rye wheat
agronomy instrumental fruit vegetable production research
agronomists biotechnology extend expedite development desired characteristics listed plant breeding section
biotechnology lab activity requiring field testing crop varieties developed
addition increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology increasingly applied food
oilseed present margarine food oils
modified produce fatty acids detergents
substitute fuels petrochemicals
agronomists study sustainable ways make soils productive profitable
classify soils reproduce determine substances vital plant growth compounds nitrogen
phosphorus
potassium
soil deficient substances
fertilizers provide
soil science involves investigation movement nutrients soil
amount nutrients absorbed plant roots
development roots relation soil
addition
agronomists develop methods preserve soil decrease effects erosion wind water
technique called contour plowing prevent soil erosion conserve rainfall
researchers agronomy seek ways soil effectively solving problems
problems include disposal human animal wastes
water pollution
build soil pesticides
tilling crops technique prevent erosion
planting soil binding grasses contours steep slopes
effect
contour drains depths metre retain soil prevent permanent wash
