Abstraction (mathematics)

abstraction
abstraction mathematics process extracting underlying essence mathematical concept
removing dependence real world objects originally connected
generalizing wider applications matching abstract descriptions equivalent phenomena
areas mathematics began study real world problems
underlying rules concepts identified defined abstract structures
geometry origins calculation distances areas real world
statistics origins calculation probabilities gambling
algebra started methods solving problems arithmetic
abstraction ongoing process mathematics historical development mathematical topics exhibits progression concrete abstract
historical development geometry
steps abstraction geometry made ancient greeks
