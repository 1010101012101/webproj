roughly start
reason emergence britain
purpose
subject debate
argued defensive sites constructed response invasion continental europe
built invaders
military reaction social tensions caused increasing population resulting pressure agriculture
dominant view increasing iron led social britain
deposits iron ore located places tin copper ore make bronze
result
trading patterns shifted
elites lost economic social status
power passed hands group people
archaeologist barry cunliffe believes population increase played role stated
forts provided defensive possibilities community times stress increasing population burst open warfare
built state war
functional defensive strongholds tensions undoubtedly attacked destroyed
