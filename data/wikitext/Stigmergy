Stigmergy

stigmergy
stigmergy mechanism indirect coordination agents actions
principle trace left environment action stimulates performance action
agent
subsequent actions tend reinforce build
leading spontaneous emergence coherent
apparently systematic activity
stigmergy form organization
produces complex
seemingly intelligent structures
planning

direct communication agents
supports efficient collaboration extremely simple agents
lack memory

stigmergy key concepts field swarm intelligence
stigmergy observed social insects
ants exchange information laying pheromones
trace
back nest found food
collectively develop complex network trails
connecting nest efficient food sources
ants nest searching food
stimulated pheromone follow trail food source
network trails functions shared external memory ant colony
computer science
general method applied variety techniques called ant colony optimization
search solutions complex problems depositing
virtual pheromones
paths promising
