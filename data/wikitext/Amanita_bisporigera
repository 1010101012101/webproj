lewis studied illustrated development basidia order compare nuclear behavior spored spored forms
initially
young basidium
appearing club shaped branch subhymenium
filled cytoplasm primary nuclei
distinct nucleoli
basidium grows larger
membranes nuclei contact
membrane disappears point contact
primary nuclei remain distinct short time
eventually nuclei fuse completely form larger secondary nucleus single secondary nucleolus
basidium increases size primary nuclei fuse
nucleus migrates end basidia
time
nucleus develops vacuoles
filled nuclear sap living cell
chromosomes produced nucleolar threads
align transversely apex basidium
connected spindles
chromosomes move poles
forming daughter nuclei occupy positions basidium
daughters structure similar parent nuclei
nuclei divide form nuclei
