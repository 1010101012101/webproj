symptoms poisoning
ocreata initially gastrointestinal nature include colicky abdominal pain
watery diarrhea vomiting lead dehydration
severe cases
hypotension
tachycardia
hypoglycemia
acid base disturbances
initial symptoms resolve days ingestion fungus
deterioration signifying liver involvement
diarrhea
delirium
seizures
coma due fulminant hepatic failure attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused accumulation liver removed substances blood
renal failure
secondary severe hepatitis caused direct toxic renal damage
coagulopathy stage
life threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure
intracranial hemorrhage
sepsis
pancreatitis
acute renal failure
cardiac arrest
death generally occurs sixteen days poisoning
consumption
ocreata medical emergency requires hospitalization
main categories therapy poisoning
preliminary medical care
supportive measures
specific treatments
liver transplantation
preliminary care consists gastric decontamination activated carbon gastric lavage
due delay ingestion symptoms poisoning
commonplace patients arrive treatment long ingestion
potentially reducing efficacy interventions
supportive measures directed treating dehydration results fluid loss gastrointestinal phase intoxication correction metabolic acidosis
hypoglycemia
electrolyte imbalances
impaired coagulation
definitive antidote amatoxin poisoning
specific treatments intravenous penicillin shown improve survivability
evidence intravenous silibinin
extract blessed milk thistle
silybum marianum
beneficial reducing effects amatoxins
preventing uptake hepatocytes
protecting undamaged hepatic tissue
patients developing liver failure
liver transplant option prevent death
liver transplants established option amatoxin poisoning
complicated issue
transplants significant complications mortality
patients require long term immunosuppression maintain transplant
evidence suggests
survival rates improved modern medical treatment
patients moderate severe poisoning half recover suffered permanent liver damage
follow study shown survivors recover completely sequelae treated mushroom ingestion
