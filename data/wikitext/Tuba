addition valves made play low harmonic series instrument complete selection notes
prior invention valves
brass instruments limited notes harmonic series
generally played high respect fundamental pitch
harmonics starting octaves fundamental pitch step
making variety notes
ophicleide bowl shaped brass instrument mouthpiece employed keys tone holes similar modern saxophone
forerunner tuba serpent
bass instrument shaped wavy form make tone holes accessible player
tone holes changed pitch providing intentional leak bugle instrument
