analytical chemistry study chemical composition natural artificial materials
unlike major disciplines chemistry inorganic chemistry organic chemistry
analytical chemistry restricted type chemical compound reaction
properties studied analytical chemistry include geometric features molecular morphologies distributions species
features composition species identity
contributions made analytical chemists played critical roles sciences ranging development concepts theories
pure science
variety practical applications
