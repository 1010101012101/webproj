archaeologists tree ring dating
dendrochronology
determine age pieces wood
trees add growth rings yearly basis
spacing rings wider high growth years narrower low growth years
patterns tree ring growth establish age wood samples
give hints local climatic conditions
technique years ago samples western united states overlapping tree ring series living dead wood
earth orbital motions
inclination earth axis orbit respect sun
gyroscopic precession earth axis years
free precession days
precession earth orbit orbital variations perihelion precession years
leave traces visible geological record
provide long term sequence climatic events
recorded thickness sediment layers
varve analysis
term
varve
means layer layers sediment
typically
varve refers lake glacial sediment
temperature induced isotopic ratios oxygen isotopes sediments
relative abundance fossils
calibrated reliably period million years alternate verification radiometric dating cases sufficient record exists provide reliable trace
polarity reversals earth magnetic field determine geologic time
periodically
