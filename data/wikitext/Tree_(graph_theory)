Tree (graph theory)

tree
mathematics
specifically graph theory
tree undirected graph vertices connected simple path
words
connected graph simple cycles tree
forest disjoint union trees
kinds data structures referred trees computer science equivalent trees graph theory
data structures commonly rooted trees
additional ordering branches
tree undirected simple graph satisfies equivalent conditions
finitely vertices
statements equivalent conditions
leaf vertex degree
internal vertex vertex degree
irreducible
series reduced
tree tree vertex degree
forest undirected graph
connected components trees
words
graph consists disjoint union trees
equivalently
forest undirected cycle free graph
special cases
empty graph
single tree
discrete graph set vertices
graph vertices edges
examples forests
term hedge refers ordered sequence trees
polytree oriented tree directed graph undirected path vertices

key data structure computer science
tree data structure
context trees supposed root
tree designated root called free tree
rooted tree
parent vertex vertex connected path root
vertex root unique parent
child vertex vertex parent
labeled tree tree vertex unique label
vertices labeled tree vertices typically labels
recursive tree labeled rooted tree vertex labels respect tree order
vertices
label smaller label

plane tree
ordering children equivalent embedding tree plane
homotopy embeddings ambient isotopy
embedding rooted tree plane
fixes direction children

embedding ordering children
conversely
ordered tree
conventionally draw root top
child nodes ordered tree drawn left
yielding essentially unique planar embedding
