initially whitish purplish pink turning brown age
dark brown hairy stem
long thick
attaches edge cap
mushroom produces white spore print roughly spherical spores
high levels humidity essential optimum fruit body development
growth inhibited excesses light darkness
fruit bodies change geotropic response times development
helps ensure teeth ultimately point downward optimum spore release
pure culture
cell division ultrastructure
hyphae mycelia studied search potentially characters phylogenetic analysis
