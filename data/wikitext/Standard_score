key point calculating requires population population standard deviation
sample sample deviation
requires knowing population parameters
statistics sample drawn population interest
knowing true standard deviation population unrealistic cases standardized testing
entire population measured
cases impossible measure member population
standard deviation estimated random sample
score test standardized testing analog student test population parameters
