electric power distribution
electricity distribution final stage delivery electricity end users
distribution system network carries electricity transmission system delivers consumers
typically
network include medium voltage
power lines
substations pole mounted transformers
low voltage
distribution wiring meters
early days electricity distribution

low voltages
volts
practical voltage incandescent lamps
primary electrical load
low voltage required insulation safe distribution buildings
losses cable proportional square current
resistance cable
reduce current size conductor required quantity power transmission require higher transmission voltage
efficient method existed change voltage power circuits
losses economically practical level edison system needed thick cables local generators
early generating plants needed
miles
farthest customer avoid excessively large expensive conductors
competition direct current
alternating current
