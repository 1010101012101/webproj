studying organization atoms
molecules bodies
drawn dimensional relativistic map world
solid block paper
physical processes microscopic level believed time symmetric
direction time reverse
theoretical statements describe remain true
macroscopic level appears case
obvious direction
flow
time
book nature physical world
helped popularize concept
eddington stated
draw arrow arbitrarily
follow arrow find random element state world
arrow pointing future
random element decreases arrow points past
distinction physics
fundamental contention admitted introduction randomness thing undone
phrase express property time analogue space
eddington points note arrow
eddington arrow direction progressive increase random element
lengthy argument nature thermodynamics concludes
physics concerned
time arrow property entropy
symmetry time
symmetry
understood simple analogy
time perfectly symmetrical video real events realistic played forwards backwards
obvious objection notion gravity
things fall
ball tossed
slows stop falls hand case recordings equally realistic forwards backwards
system symmetrical
forward
kinetic energy dissipated entropy increased
entropy processes time reversible
statistical notion increasing entropy
arrow
time identified decrease free energy
record dropping ball falls meter stops
reverse notice unrealistic discrepancy
ball falling upward
ball lands kinetic energy dispersed sound
shock waves heat
reverse sound waves
ground vibrations heat rush back ball
imparting energy propel upward meter person hand
unrealism lies statistical unlikelihood forces coincide propel ball upward waiting hand
arrow time
direction
asymmetry
time
thermodynamic arrow time provided law thermodynamics
isolated system
entropy increase time
entropy thought measure microscopic disorder
law implies time asymmetrical respect amount order isolated system
system advances time
statistically disordered
asymmetry empirically distinguish future past measuring entropy accurately measure time
open system entropy decrease time
british physicist sir alfred brian pippard wrote
justification view
glibly repeated
law thermodynamics statistically true
sense microscopic violations repeatedly occur
violations magnitude
contrary
evidence presented law breaks circumstances
number paradoxes breakage law thermodynamics
due recurrence theorem
arrow time related arrows time arguably underlies
exception weak arrow time
cosmological arrow time points direction universe expansion
linked thermodynamic arrow
universe heading heat death
big chill
amount usable energy negligible
alternatively
artifact place universe evolution
anthropic bias
arrow reversing gravity pulls back big crunch
arrow time related arrows time
future definition direction universe bigger
universe expands shrinks definition
thermodynamic arrow time law thermodynamics thought consequence initial conditions early universe
ultimately result cosmological set
waves
radio waves sound waves pond throwing stone
expand outward source
wave equations solutions convergent waves radiative
arrow reversed carefully worked experiments created convergent waves
arrow thermodynamic arrow meeting conditions produce convergent wave requires order conditions radiative wave
put differently
probability initial conditions produce convergent wave lower probability initial conditions produce radiative wave
fact
radiative wave increases entropy
convergent wave decreases itcitation needed
making contradictory law thermodynamics usual circumstances

causality intimately bound time arrow
epistemological problem causality arrow time
david hume maintained

noting law thermodynamics amounts observation nature shows bias collapsing wave functions higher entropy states versus lower
