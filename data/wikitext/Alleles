allele
pron
number alternative forms gene genetic locus
generally group genes
alternative form gene character producing effects
form
allel
abbreviation allelomorph
alleles result observable phenotypic traits
pigmentation
variations genetic level result observable variation
multicellular organisms sets chromosomes
diploid
chromosomes referred homologous chromosomes
diploid organisms copy gene
