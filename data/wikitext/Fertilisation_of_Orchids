Fertilisation of Orchids

fertilisation orchids
fertilisation orchids book english naturalist charles darwin published full explanatory title contrivances british foreign orchids fertilised insects
good effects intercrossing
darwin previous book
origin species
briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions insects plants fertilised
idea explored detail
field studies practical scientific investigations initially recreation relief drudgery enjoyable challenging experiments
aided work family
friends
wide circle correspondents britain worldwide
darwin tapped contemporary vogue growing exotic orchids
book detailed demonstration power natural selection
explained complex ecological relationships resulted coevolution orchids insects
view expressed book led directly indirectly modern work coevolution evolution extreme specialisation
influenced botanists
revived interest neglected idea insects played part pollinating flowers
opened study areas pollination research reproductive ecology
directly related darwin ideas evolution
supported view natural selection led variety forms important benefits achieved cross fertilisation
general public showed interest sales book low
established darwin leading botanist
orchids series books innovative investigations plants
book describes relationship insects plants resulted beautiful complex forms natural theology attributed grand designer
showing practical adaptations develop cumulative minor variations parts flowers suit purposes
darwin countered prevailing view beautiful organisms handiwork creator
darwin painstaking observations
experiments
detailed dissection flowers explained previously unknown features puzzle catasetum
thought completely species flowers plant
addition
produced testable predictions including controversial proposal long nectary angraecum sesquipedale meant moth equally long proboscis
confirmed xanthopan morgani praedicta found madagascar
