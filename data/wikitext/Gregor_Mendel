study variation plants
conducted study monastery hectares
experimental garden
originally planted napp
mendel cultivated tested pea plants
pisum sativum
study showed pea plants purebred recessive alleles
hybrid purebred dominant
experiments led make generalizations
law segregation law independent assortment
mendel laws inheritance
mendel read paper

lifetime
biologists held idea characteristics passed generation blending inheritance
traits parent averaged
instances phenomenon explained action multiple genes quantitative effects
charles darwin unsuccessfully explain inheritance theory pangenesis
early century importance mendel ideas realized
research aimed finding successful theory discontinuous inheritance blending inheritance led independent duplication work hugo vries carl correns
rediscovery mendel writings laws
acknowledged mendel priority
thought probable vries understand results found reading mendel
erich von tschermak originally credited rediscovery
longer accepted understand mendel laws
vries lost interest mendelism
biologists started establish genetics science
mendel results quickly replicated
genetic linkage quickly worked
biologists flocked theory
applicable phenomena
sought give genotypic understanding heredity felt lacking previous studies heredity focused phenotypic approaches
prominent approaches biometric school karl pearson
weldon
based heavily statistical studies phenotype variation
strongest opposition school william bateson
early days publicising benefits mendel theory
word
genetics
discipline terminology
originated bateson
debate biometricians mendelians extremely vigorous decades twentieth century
biometricians claiming statistical mathematical rigor
mendelians claimed understanding biology
end
approaches combined
work conducted
fisher early
combination
mendelian genetics darwin theory natural selection resulted modern synthesis evolutionary biology
mendel experimental results object considerable dispute
fisher analyzed results
filial
ratio found implausibly close exact ratio
reproduction experiments demonstrated validity
results continued mystery
cited confirmation bias
arise detected approximate ratio early experiments small sample size
continued collecting data results conformed exact ratio
suggested censored results
traits occur separate chromosome pair
extremely occurrence chosen random
fact
genes mendel studied occurred linkage groups
gene pair
close show deviation independent assortment
pair mendel studied
recent researchers suggested fisher criticisms mendel work exaggerated
