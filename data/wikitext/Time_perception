Time perception

time perception
time perception field study psychology neuroscience
refers sense time
differs senses time directly perceived reconstructed brain
humans perceive short periods time
order milliseconds
durations significant fraction lifetime
human perception duration subjective variable
researchers attempt categorize people differ perception time
personality characteristics
pioneering work
emphasizing species specific differences

prototype conceived times
short duration immediately incessantly
broad
scientific thought
elaborated concept specious present
considered specious present considered temporal equivalent sensory datum
psychologists assert time faster age
literature age related perception time remains controversial
day eleven year approximately

life
day longer young child adult
experiment comparing group subjects aged group asked estimate thought minutes passed
found younger group estimate average minutes seconds
older group averaged minutes seconds
indicating change perception time age
people tend recall recent events occurring back time
backward telescoping
distant events occurring recently
forward telescoping
proposed subjective experience time age due individual biological makeup
temporal illusion distortion sensory perception caused time occurrence events short
typically
cases person misperceive temporal order events
kappa effect form temporal illusion verifiable experiment time intervals visual events perceived longer shorter depending relative spatial positions events
words
perception temporal intervals appears directly affected
cases
perception spatial intervals

schizophrenic patients stop perceiving time flow causally linked events
suggested delay time perception schizophrenic patients compared normal subjects
defects time perception play part hallucinations delusions experienced schizophrenic patients studies
researchers suggest
abnormal timing judgment leads deficit action attribution action perception
researchers aim explain differences people relate time perform tasks
claim time perception influenced internal personal characteristics external environmental factors
theorists suggest time perception categorized axes
time perspective
time urgency
ideas occupational psychology settings
axes typically create personalities differ personal characteristics deal tasks
time perspective affected genetics
culture
religion
arise education
family
past employment
timeline axis moves past
present future
time perspective axis organized
people present perspective time tendency actions present significantly affect future
people action performed present increase probability future outcome
people perspective tend phrase
today tomorrow
individuals personality characteristics present time perspective tend unnecessary make future plans
individuals tend risks act impulsively
people future perspective tend action performed present increases probability future outcome
people goal oriented
high capacity infer future results

time urgency relates quick response action
achieve goal
existence feeling
axis ranging high low
dimensions produce types personalities
