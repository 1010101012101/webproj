phrase

natural selection
precise meaning term subtle
modern evolutionary theory defines fitness long organism lives
successful reproducing
organism lives half long species
offspring surviving adulthood
genes common adult population generation
natural selection acts individuals
effects chance fitness defined
average
individuals population
fitness genotype corresponds average effect individuals genotype
low fitness genotypes bearers offspring average
examples include human genetic disorders cystic fibrosis
fitness averaged quantity
favorable mutation arises individual survive adulthood unrelated reasons
fitness depends crucially environment
conditions sickle cell anemia low fitness general human population
sickle cell trait confers immunity malaria
high fitness populations high malaria infection rates

science journalists distinguish gene selection natural selection informally referencing selection mutations
pre selection
selection level gene result increase fitness gene
time reducing fitness individuals carrying gene
process called intragenomic conflict
combined effect selection pressures levels determines fitness individual
outcome natural selection
natural selection occurs life stage individual
individual organism survive adulthood reproduce
selection reach stage called viability selection
species
adults compete mates sexual selection
success competition determines parent generation
individuals reproduce
longer survival reproductive phase increases number offspring
called survival selection

ecological selection covers mechanism selection result environment
including relatives
kin selection
competition

sexual selection
refers specifically competition mates
sexual selection intrasexual
cases competition individuals sex population
intersexual
cases sex controls reproductive access choosing population mates
commonly
intrasexual selection involves competition intersexual selection involves female choice suitable males
due generally greater investment resources female male single offspring
species exhibit sex role reversed behavior males selective mate choice
examples pattern occur fishes family syngnathidae
examples found amphibian bird species

traits speciation
presence heritable genetic variation results fitness differences
genetic variation result mutations
recombinations alterations karyotype

effect highly advantageous highly disadvantageous
large effects rare
past
genetic material considered neutral close neutral occurred noncoding dna resulted synonymous substitution
recent research suggests mutations coding dna slight deleterious effects
mutation rates average fitness effects mutations dependent organism
estimates data humans found majority mutations slightly deleterious
definition fitness
individuals greater fitness contribute offspring generation
individuals lesser fitness die early fail reproduce
result
alleles average result greater fitness abundant generation
alleles general reduce fitness rarer
selection forces remain generations
beneficial alleles abundant
dominate population
alleles lesser fitness disappear
generation
mutations combinations arise spontaneously
producing spectrum phenotypes
generation enriched increasing abundance alleles contribute traits favored selection
enhancing traits successive generations
mutations occur called regulatory genes
large effects phenotype individual regulate function genes
mutations regulatory genes result viable zygotes
examples nonlethal regulatory mutations occur hox genes humans
result cervical rib polydactyly
increase number fingers toes
mutations result higher fitness
natural selection favor phenotypes trait spread population
established traits immutable
traits high fitness environmental context fit environmental conditions change
absence natural selection preserve trait
variable deteriorate time
possibly resulting vestigial manifestation trait
called evolutionary baggage
