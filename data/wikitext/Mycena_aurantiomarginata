mycena aurantiomarginata tetrapolar mating system
genes locations chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility
mating type
system prevents fertilization ensures high degree genotypic diversity
fungal mycelia grown culture petri dish
colonies white
odorless
typically central patch congested aerial hyphae grow upward colony surface
abruptly flattened submerged
occasionally form faint zone lines
hyphae commonly form deposits tiny amorphous crystals contact mycelial fronts
hyphae vegetatively incompatible destroy lysis

pigment compound isolated characterized fruit bodies mycena aurantiomarginata reported science robert jaeger peter spiteller journal natural products
chemical
polyene compound consists tridecaketide
adjacent methylene bridge carbonyl functional groups amino acid moieties end molecule
authors posit flanking amino acid groups derived biosynthetically adenosyl methionine
tridecaketide alpha pyrone
conjugated hexaene
single alkenyl moiety
jaeger spiteller suggest function defense compound
antibacterial activity gram positive bacterium bacillus pumilus
chemical present fruit bodies
colorless mycelia
earlier screening antimicrobial activity fruit bodies revealed weak ability inhibit growth fungi candida albicans aspergillus fumigatus
