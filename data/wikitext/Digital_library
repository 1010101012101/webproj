digital libraries provide search interface resources found
resources typically deep web

resources frequently located search engine crawlers
digital libraries create special pages sitemaps search engines find resources

general strategies searching federation digital libraries
distributed searching typically involves client sending multiple search requests parallel number servers federation
results gathered
duplicates eliminated clustered
remaining items sorted presented back client
protocols
frequently distributed searching
benefit approach resource intensive tasks indexing storage left respective servers federation
drawback approach search mechanism limited indexing ranking capabilities database
making difficult assemble combined result consisting relevant found items
searching previously harvested metadata involves searching locally stored index information previously collected libraries federation
search performed
search mechanism make connections digital libraries searching local representation information
approach requires creation indexing harvesting mechanism operates regularly
connecting digital libraries querying collection order discover updated resources
oai pmh frequently digital libraries allowing metadata harvested
benefit approach search mechanism full control indexing ranking algorithms
possibly allowing consistent results
drawback harvesting indexing systems resource intensive expensive

google book scanning project working libraries offer digitize books pushing forward digitize book realm
advantages digital libraries means easily rapidly accessing books
archives images types widely recognized commercial interests public bodies alike
traditional libraries limited storage space
digital libraries potential store information

digital libraries adopt innovations technology providing users improvements electronic audio book technology presenting forms communication wikis blogs
conventional libraries providing online access opac catalogue sufficient
important advantage digital conversion increased accessibility users
increase availability individuals traditional patrons library
