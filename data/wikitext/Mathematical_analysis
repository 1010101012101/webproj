mathematical analysis
mathematical analysis branch pure mathematics includes theories differentiation
integration
measure
limits
infinite series
analytic functions
theories studied context real complex numbers functions
analysis evolved calculus
involves elementary concepts techniques analysis
analysis distinguished geometry
applied space mathematical objects definition nearness
topological space
specific distances objects
metric space
early results analysis implicitly present early days ancient greek mathematics
instance
infinite geometric sum implicit zeno paradox dichotomy
greek mathematicians eudoxus archimedes made explicit
informal
concepts limits convergence method exhaustion compute area volume regions solids
india
century mathematician gave examples derivative rolle theorem
century
madhava sangamagrama developed infinite series expansions
power series taylor series
functions sine
cosine
tangent arctangent
alongside development taylor series trigonometric functions
estimated magnitude error terms created truncating series gave rational approximation infinite series
followers kerala school astronomy mathematics expanded works
century
europe
half century
newton leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus
grew
stimulus applied work continued
analysis topics calculus variations
ordinary partial differential equations
fourier analysis
generating functions
period
calculus techniques applied approximate discrete problems continuous
century
euler introduced notion mathematical function
real analysis began emerge independent subject bernard bolzano introduced modern definition continuity
bolzano work widely
cauchy began put calculus firm logical foundation rejecting principle generality algebra widely earlier work
euler
cauchy formulated calculus terms geometric ideas infinitesimals
definition continuity required infinitesimal change correspond infinitesimal change
introduced concept cauchy sequence
started formal theory complex analysis
poisson
liouville
fourier studied partial differential equations harmonic analysis
contributions mathematicians
weierstrass
developed
definition limit approach
founding modern field mathematical analysis
middle century riemann introduced theory integration
century arithmetization analysis weierstrass
thought geometric reasoning inherently misleading
introduced
epsilon delta
definition limit
mathematicians started worrying assuming existence continuum real numbers proof
dedekind constructed real numbers dedekind cuts
irrational numbers formally defined
serve fill
gaps
rational numbers
creating complete set
continuum real numbers
developed simon stevin terms decimal expansions
time
attempts refine theorems riemann integration led study
size
set discontinuities real functions
monsters
continuous functions
continuous differentiable functions
space filling curves
began investigated
context
jordan developed theory measure
cantor developed called naive set theory
baire proved baire category theorem
early century
calculus formalized axiomatic set theory
lebesgue solved problem measure
hilbert introduced hilbert spaces solve integral equations
idea normed vector space air
banach created functional analysis
mathematical analysis includes subfields
classical analysis understood work functional analysis techniques
called hard analysis
naturally refers traditional topics
study differential equations shared fields dynamical systems theory
overlap conventional analysis large
techniques analysis found areas
motivation studying mathematical analysis wider context topological metric spaces threefold
section topological spaces makes clear
analysis continuity traditional sense real numbers
analysis fundamentally functions
spaces functions act function spaces functions members
discrete function
called sequence
sequence finite sequence data source infinite sequence discrete dynamical system
discrete function defined explicitly list
formula
implicitly recurrence relation difference equation
difference equation discrete equivalent differential equation approximate studied
question method differential equations discrete equivalent difference equations
instance integral transforms harmonic analysis studying continuous functions analog signals
discrete transforms discrete functions digital signals
discrete metric general discrete finite metric spaces finite topological spaces
