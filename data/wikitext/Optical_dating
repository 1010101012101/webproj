Optical dating

optical dating
optical dating method determining long ago minerals exposed daylight
geologists archaeologists event occurred
alternate names optically stimulated luminescence dating
osl dating
photoluminescence dating
dating
ages determined typically years
reliable suitable methods proper checks
ages obtained range
regarded caution
accuracy obtainable optimum circumstances

optical dating method relies assumption mineral grains sufficiently exposed sunlight buried
case aeolian deposits
sand dunes loess
water laid deposits
sediments soils trace amounts radioactive isotopes including uranium
thorium
rubidium potassium
slowly decay time ionizing radiation produce absorbed constituents soil sediments quartz feldspar
resulting radiation damage minerals remains structurally unstable electron traps mineral grains
stimulating samples blue
green infrared light luminescence signal emitted stored unstable electron energy released
intensity varies depending amount radiation absorbed burial
radiation damage accumulates rate time determined amount radioactive elements sample
exposure sunlight resets luminescence signal time period soil buried calculated
