contextual seriation based presence absence design style
frequency seriation relies measuring proportional abundance frequency design style
contextual seriation reconstructing chronological sequence graves presence absence design style type important
frequency seriation applied case large quantities objects belonging style
assemblages pottery sherds including roughly range types proportions
flinders petrie excavated diospolis parva egypt late nineteenth century
found graves uncovering contained evidence dates discrete nature meant sequence constructed stratigraphy
petrie listed contents grave strip cardboard swapped papers arrived sequence satisfied
reasoned accurate sequence concentrations design styles shortest duration sequence papers

shennan
assuming design styles follow bell curve starting slowly
growing peak dying style basis frequency seriation
assumes design popularity broadly similar site site culture
addition
vital lifespans design styles overlap
rules
assemblage objects sequence sites similar proportions styles
lock
task identifying design styles
form groups objects belonging design style means trivial
creating typology frequently basis seriation
errors typology result errors seriation
design style peaks popularity
bimodal distribution
design style seriation inclusion analysis result strange results
design styles long time shape constructed handy improvement ornament added
design styles eligible chronological seriation
knives early medieval times europe show chronological variation
addition temporal organization
seriation results reflect assemblage differences social status
age
sex resulting regional variation
combination factors
shennan

axes
swords
result chronological sequence due selection types
ordering start extremely male hoards ends extremely female
doran hodson
list conditions satisfied obtain chronological seriation result
nowadays
seriation results longer produced manually petrie times algorithms

technique
sequence objects design styles established
note external evidence needed establish direction sequence calculated
method object sequence oldest youngest object
kendall
applied multidimensional scaling cemetery data
resulting scatterplot showed form horse shoe graves arranged curve chronological order
similarly
mapping component scores axes correspondence analysis result display parabola design styles considered controlled factor

called arch effect hill gauch
kendall jensen nielsen
created artificial data sets show parabola results ideal circumstances
recommended inspecting scatterplot axes correspondence analysis find factors play role
examples
factor important
arch effect distort results
hill gauch
presented method remove effect
groenen poblome adapted correspondence analysis algorithm combine seriation absolute dates stratigraphic relationships

bottle

contextual seriation sorts design styles contexts star symbols found close diagonal table
small examples
computer programs needed find ordering
larger data sets graves studied petrie extremely helpful
data presented simulated winbasp
initially contexts
called units winbasp
created types
contexts labeled chronological order numbers
types labeled form
type represented object object relevant chronological sequence provide link context
similarly
contexts object irrelevant seriation
contexts object types represented object eliminated
resulting raw simulated data consisting contexts types shown left
expected
dots indicating occurrence type context close diagonal table
image hand side shows result seriation data set
note dots compact diagonal table compared raw data
shows minor problem seriation
fact
intervals production longer calculated algorithm
general
sequences contexts types calculated seriation algorithm correct chronological sequences fairly close
image shows scatterplot typical parabola shape axes correspondence analysis contexts simulated data set
contingency table shows contexts ideal seriation data created kendall jensen nielsen
context type appears type disappears
regular data
reasonable assume constant time intervals contexts adjacent time
correspondence analysis results shown figures calculated basis contexts ideal seriation data
scatterplot correspondence analysis axes shows typical parabola shape
display scores axes exhibits points lying degree polynomial curve
similarly
plot scores fourth axes show fourth degree polynomial ideal data
note distances scores adjacent contexts axis vary
beginning end
distances extremely small
largest distances centre times large smallest distance
hill gauch
created similar contingency table regular structure context types
note
context distances smaller ends middle
reasons proposed adjustment called detrended correspondence analysis
archaeologists linear transformation scores axis basis absolute dates create good estimates unknown absolute dates
approach basis method presented groenen poblome
combine relative absolute dates
ideal shows linear transformation cases
simulation study van velden
groenen poblome conclusion predictions approach good
