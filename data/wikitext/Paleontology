paleontology seeks map living things changed time
substantial hurdle aim difficulty working fossils
beds preserve fossils typically lack radioactive elements needed radiometric dating
technique means giving rocks greater million years absolute age
accurate
radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work
basic principle simple
rates radioactive elements decay
ratio radioactive element element decays shows long ago radioactive element incorporated rock
radioactive elements common rocks volcanic origin
fossil bearing rocks dated radiometrically volcanic ash layers
palaeontologists rely stratigraphy date fossils
stratigraphy science deciphering
layer cake
sedimentary record
compared jigsaw puzzle
rocks form horizontal layers
layer younger underneath
fossil found layers ages
fossil age lie ages
rock sequences continuous
broken faults periods erosion
difficult match rock beds directly
fossils species survived short time link isolated rocks
technique called biostratigraphy
instance
conodont eoplacognathus pseudoplanus short range middle ordovician period
rocks unknown age found traces
pseudoplanus
mid ordovician age
index fossils distinctive
globally distributed short time range
misleading results produced index fossils turn longer fossil ranges thought
stratigraphy biostratigraphy general provide relative dating
sufficient studying evolution
difficult time periods
problems involved matching rocks age continents
family tree relationships narrow date lineages appeared
