xml
popular format data representation recent years
xml data stored normal file systems
commonly held relational databases advantage
robust implementation verified years theoretical practical effort
evolution standard generalized markup language
sgml
xml text based structure offers advantage machine human readable
relational database model introduced programming language independent structured query language
