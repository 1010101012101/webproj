acoustic guitar guitar acoustic sound board transmitting strings vibrational energy air order produce sound
initial timbre harmonics sound acoustic guitar produced plucking string
frequencies produced depend string length

undamped resonance
acoustic guitar soundboard strong effect loudness guitar
amplification occurs process
sense energy externally added increase loudness sound
case electronic amplifier
energy provided plucking string
soundboard

cut
air moving
soundboard increases surface vibrating area
initially strings
process called impedance matching
soundboard easier task move air string
large
push
air impedance soundboard closer impedance air impedance strings
process increases entire system transfer efficiency energy initially confined string moves air
louder sound emitted
addition
acoustic guitar hollow body additional coupling resonance effect increases efficiency energy transmission lower frequencies
air guitar cavity resonates vibrational modes string soundboard
low frequencies
depend size box

function entire acoustic system twofold
color sound generation amplification harmonics
maximize coupling energy surrounding air ultimately perceive loudness produced sound
improved coupling
expense decay time
string energy efficiently transmitted

key reason guitars tonal qualities
sound complex mixture harmonics give guitar distinctive sound
acoustic guitar amplified types pickups microphones
common type pickups acoustic guitar amplification piezo magnetic pickups
piezo pickups generally mounted bridge saddle acoustic guitar plugged mixer amplifier
magnetic pickups generally mounted sound hole acoustic guitar similar found electric guitars
acoustic guitar pickups electrical amplification acoustic electric guitar
acoustic guitar difficult amplify faithfullyclarification needed
