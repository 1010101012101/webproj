ratio moves equilibrium
process called racemization
measuring ratio sample enables estimate long ago specimen died
rate racemization proceeds depends type amino acid average temperature

characteristics enclosing matrix
concentration thresholds occur sudden decreases rate racemization
effects restrict amino acid chronologies materials environmental histories
relative intercomparisons dating methods
temperature humidity histories microenvironments produced increasing rates technologies advance technologists accumulate data
important amino acid dating racemization occurs faster warm
wet conditions compared cold
dry conditions
temperate cold region studies common tropical studies
steady cold ocean floor dry interior bones shells contributed accumulation racemization dating data
rule thumb
sites annual temperature maximum range resolution
sites maximum age range
resolution generally age
reaction maximum age
correspondingly coarser resolution
strong acidity mild strong alkalinity induce greatly increased racemization rates
