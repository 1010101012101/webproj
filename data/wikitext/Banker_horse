feral horses
thought bankers arrived barrier islands century
hypotheses advanced explain horses origins
fully verified
theory ancestors banker swam ashore wrecked spanish galleons
ships returning spain americas advantage gulf stream continental trade winds

ships sank close land horses made shores
alternatively
hazardous weather
ships refuge close shore
horses turned loose
presence horses spanish treasure ships space primarily intended transporting riches gold silver
conjecture breed descended brought islands spanish explorer lucas
attempted colonization san miguel gualdape
santee river south carolina
failed
forcing colonists move
possibly north carolina
original subsequently died
result desertion
disease
early frost
lacking effective leadership
settlement lasted months
survivors abandoned colony fled hispaniola
leaving horses
similar theory sir richard grenville brought horses islands
attempt establish english naval base
expedition vessels ran aground wococon
present day ocracoke
documents ships carried types livestock obtained trade hispaniola
including
mares

scholars crew attempted lighten ship

limited nutrients diet

horses living closer human habitation
currituck banks
grazed residential lawns landscaping
domesticated bankers raised manufactured horse feed early age tend exhibit slightly larger frames
water limiting resource bankers
islands surrounded salt water freshwater springs permanent ponds
horses dependent ephemeral pools rainwater moisture vegetation consume
bankers dig shallow holes
ranging

reach fresh groundwater
occasionally
resort drinking seawater
bloated appearance
consequence water retention caused body effort maintain osmotic balance
national park service
nps
concerned impact bankers environmental health north carolina barrier islands
initially
nps believed native bankers completely consume spartina alterniflora grasses maritime forests
thought essential survival
research provided information horses diet suggested
half diet consisted spartina
nutrients maritime forest
study concluded sufficient nutrients replenished ocean tide prevent decline vegetative growth overgrazing
study declared greatest impact plant life grazing damage plants sustained trampled horses hooves
bankers pose threat ground nesting animals sea turtles shorebirds
feral horses interrupt nesting activities
crush young
bankers part north carolina coastal heritage
allowed remain barrier islands
cope expanding population
prevent inbreeding attempt minimize environmental damage
