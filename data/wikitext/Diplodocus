depiction diplodocus posture changed considerably years
instance
classic reconstruction oliver
hay depicts diplodocus splayed lizard limbs banks river
hay argued diplodocus sprawling
lizard gait widely splayed legs
supported gustav tornier
hypothesis contested william jacob holland
demonstrated sprawling diplodocus needed trench pull belly

diplodocids portrayed necks held high air

scientists kent stephens argue sauropods including diplodocus raise heads shoulder level
subsequent studies demonstrated tetrapods hold necks maximum vertical extension normal
