breeding season
american white ibis gathers huge colonies water
pairs predominantly monogamous parents care young
males tend engage extra pair copulation females increase reproductive success
males found pirate food unmated females juveniles breeding season
human pollution affected behavior american white ibis increase concentrations methylmercury
released environment untreated waste
exposure methylmercury alters hormone levels american white ibis
affecting mating nesting behavior leading lower reproduction rates

success rate parents raising young days age ranges widely nests
varies greatly nearby colonies
american white ibis parents supplement chicks diet items cockroaches rotting food human garbage poorer years
fish crayfish scarce
studies shown years higher nesting numbers significantly faster spring drying rates water bodies years low nesting numbers
faster drying rates means fewer fish increased area crayfish hunted

american white ibis exhibit sex dependent pre fledgling mortality
