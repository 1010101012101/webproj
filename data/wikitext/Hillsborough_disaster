lord taylor acknowledged aggravated situation
secondary factors
witness estimates number fans drunk varied minority large proportion crowd
clear fans drinking
lord taylor unequivocally stated
drunk

concluded formed exacerbating factor
police
seeking rationalise loss control
overestimated element drunkenness crowd
hillsborough independent panel noted
dismissed taylor report
idea alcohol contributed disaster proved remarkably durable
documents disclosed confirm repeated attempts made find supporting evidence alcohol factor
evidence significantly misinterpreted
noted
weight alcohol face objective evidence pattern consumption modest leisure event inappropriate
fuelled persistent unsustainable assertions drunken fan behaviour
possibility fans attempting gain entry forged tickets suggested contributing factor
south yorkshire police suggested late arrival fans amounted conspiracy gain entry tickets
