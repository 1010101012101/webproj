Absolute time and space

absolute time space
originally introduced sir isaac newton naturalis principia mathematica
concepts absolute time space provided theoretical foundation facilitated newtonian mechanics
newton
absolute time space independent aspects objective reality
absolute
true mathematical time
nature flows equably regard external
called duration
relative
apparent common time
external
accurate unequable
measure duration means motion
commonly true time
newton
absolute time exists independently perceiver progresses consistent pace universe
unlike relative time
newton believed absolute time imperceptible understood mathematically
newton
humans capable perceiving relative time
measurement perceivable objects motion
moon sun
movements
infer passage time
quote newton
absolute space
nature
regard external
remains similar immovable
relative space movable dimension measure absolute spaces
senses determine position bodies
vulgarly immovable space
absolute motion translation body absolute place
relative motion
translation relative place
notions imply absolute space time depend physical events
backdrop stage setting physical phenomena occur
object absolute state motion relative absolute space
object state absolute rest
moving absolute speed
support views
newton provided empirical examples
newton
solitary rotating sphere inferred rotate axis relative absolute space observing bulging equator
solitary pair spheres tied rope inferred absolute rotation center gravity
barycenter
observing tension rope
absolute time space continue classical mechanics
modern formulations authors walter noll clifford truesdell linear algebra elastic moduli topology functional analysis linear field theories
idea absolute space proved controversial newton time present
leibniz opinion space made sense relative location bodies
time made sense relative movement bodies
bishop berkeley suggested
lacking point reference
sphere empty universe conceived rotate
pair spheres conceived rotate relative
rotate center gravity
recent form objections made ernst mach
mach principle proposes mechanics relative motion bodies
mass expression relative motion
single particle universe bodies mass
mach
newton examples simply illustrate relative rotation spheres bulk universe
body preserves unchanged direction velocity space
assertion abbreviated reference entire universe
mach
quoted ciufolini wheeler
views opposing absolute space time modern stance attempt introduce operational definitions space time
perspective made explicit special theory relativity
context newtonian mechanics
modern view absolute space unnecessary
notion inertial frame reference precedence
preferred set frames reference move uniformly respect
laws physics transform inertial frame galilean relativity
leading objections absolute space
outlined milutin
newton recognized role inertial frames
motions bodies included space
space rest moves uniformly forward straight line
practical matter
inertial frames frames moving uniformly respect fixed stars
inertial frame reference discussion

absolute simultaneity refers experimental establishment coincidence events time locations space manner agreed observers universe
theory relativity postulates maximum rate transmission information speed light
