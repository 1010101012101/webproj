toxins found galerina marginata amatoxins
amatoxins belong family bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed amino acid ring bridged sulphur atom characterized differences side groups
compounds responsible fatal mushroom poisonings humans
amatoxins inhibit enzyme rna polymerase
copies genetic code dna messenger rna molecules
toxin naturally accumulates liver cells
ensuing disruption metabolism accounts severe liver dysfunction amatoxins
amatoxins lead kidney failure
kidneys attempt filter poison
damages convoluted tubules reenters blood recirculate damage
initial symptoms ingestion include severe abdominal pain
vomiting
diarrhea hours
