manuscript mysterium contained extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism biblical passages support geocentrism
support mentor michael maestlin
kepler received permission university senate publish manuscript
pending removal bible exegesis addition simpler
understandable description copernican system ideas
mysterium published late
kepler received copies began sending prominent astronomers patrons early
widely read
established reputation highly skilled astronomer
effusive dedication
powerful patrons men controlled position graz
provided crucial doorway patronage system
details modified light work
kepler relinquished platonist polyhedral spherist cosmology mysterium cosmographicum
subsequent main astronomical works sense developments
concerned finding precise outer dimensions spheres calculating eccentricities planetary orbits
kepler published expanded edition mysterium
