Interchange (road)

interchange
field road transport
interchange road junction typically grade separation
ramps
permit traffic highway pass junction directly crossing traffic stream
differs standard intersection
roads cross grade
interchanges roads limited access divided highway
expressway freeway
occasionally junctions surface streets

vehicles cross targeted route
bear sharply curved ramp loops roughly degrees
merging interchanging road
crossing route departed
major advantage cloverleafs require bridge
makes junctions inexpensive long land plentiful
major shortcoming cloverleafs
weaving
definition
consequent low capacity design
cloverleafs considerable area land
suitable countries united states canada
parclos
partial cloverleaf interchanges
germany
standard design separate turning traffic parallel carriageway minimize problem weaving
collector distributor roads similar
separated main carriageway divider
guard rail jersey barrier
cloverleafs found older highways
rural areas
cities low population densities
stack interchange interchange left turns handled semi directional flyover
ramps

countries left hand drive
vehicles turn slightly
turn ramp

complete turn ramp crosses highways
eventually merging turn ramp traffic opposite quadrant interchange
stack interchange
pairs left turning ramps
stacked configurations interchanging highways
stacks suffer problem weaving require massive construction work flyovers
standard stack interchange includes roads levels
significantly expensive interchanges
additionally suffer objections local residents
high visual impact
large stacks multiple levels complex appearance colloquially mixing bowls

partial cloverleaf interchange
parclo
designs modified freeway traffic emerged
eventually leading cloverstack interchange
ramps longer higher ramp speeds
loop ramp radii made larger
large loop ramps eliminate fourth
level typical stack interchange
directions travel flyover
ramps
cloverstacks cheaper build stack interchanges eyesore local residents
loop ramps opposite quadrants
weaving eliminated
cloverstacks require lot land construct loop ramps efficient flyover
ramps terms traffic flow
cloverstack design popular
commonly upgrade cloverleaf interchanges increase capacity eliminate weaving

whirlpool interchange requires fewer levels
retaining semi directional ramps
left turning ramps sweep center interchange spiral pattern hand driving
turbine interchanges offer slightly vehicle capacity ramps typically turn change height quicker
require land construct typical level stack interchange
areas rolling mountainous terrain
turbine interchanges advantage natural topography land due constant change height ramps
commonly areas conditions apply
reducing construction costs compared turbine interchanges built level ground
alternative found united kingdom called roundabout interchange

full interchange
directional interchange
typically interchange required highways interchanging semi parallel
perpendicular directions
