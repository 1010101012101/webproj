promotes standardized optical storage formats
optical discs durable earlier audio visual data storage formats
susceptible environmental daily damage
libraries archives enact optical media preservation procedures ensure continued usability computer optical disc drive disc player
computer data backup physical data transfer
optical discs cds dvds gradually replaced faster
smaller
reliable solid state devices
usb flash drive
trend expected continue usb flash drives continue increase capacity drop price
similarly
personal portable players supplanted portable solid state digital audio player
players
