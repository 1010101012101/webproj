Variable (computer science)

variable
computer programming
variable storage location symbolic
identifier
unknown quantity information
variable usual reference stored
separation content independently exact information represents
identifier computer source code bound run time
variable change program execution
variables programming directly correspond concept variables mathematics
computing variable necessarily part equation formula mathematics
computing
variable employed repetitive process
assigned place
reassigned
iteration
variables computer programming frequently long names make descriptive
variables mathematics terse
character names brevity transcription manipulation
variable storage location referred identifiers
situation aliasing
assigning variable identifiers change accessed identifiers
compilers replace variables symbolic names actual locations data
variable
type
location remain fixed
data stored location changed program execution
imperative programming languages
values generally accessed changed time
pure functional logic languages
variables bound expressions single entire lifetime due requirements referential transparency
imperative languages
behavior exhibited constants
typically contrasted normal variables
depending type system programming language
variables store datatype
integer string
alternatively
datatype current
allowing single variable store supported programming language
identifier referencing variable access variable order read

scope variable property variable
extent property variable
variable scope affects extent
scope lexical aspect variable
languages define specific scope variable
named entity

scope variable portion program code variable meaning variable
visible
entrance scope typically begins variable lifetime exit scope typically ends lifetime

binding variable extent runtime
extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer memory location
running program enter leave extent times
case closure
programming language features garbage collection
variable extent permanently outlasts scope result memory leak
memory allocated variable freed variable reference deallocation purposes longer accessible
permissible variable binding extend scope
occurs lisp closures static local variables
execution passes back variable scope

variable extent ends scope dangling pointer deemed uninitialized destroyed
variables previous cases extent unbound

space efficiency
memory space needed variable allocated variable freed longer needed
variable needed scope
beginning variable lifetime enters scope give space unused variables
avoid wasting space
compilers warn programmers variable declared
considered good programming practice make scope variables narrow feasible parts program accidentally interact modifying variables
prevents action distance
common techniques sections program spaces
make individual variables
private
dynamic variable scoping lexical variable scoping
programming languages employ reserved
named null nil
invalid uninitialized variable
statically typed languages java
variable type
meaning kinds values stored
variable type
integer
prohibited storing text values
dynamically typed languages python
values
variables
carry type
common lisp
situations exist simultaneously
variable type
undeclared
assumed
universal supertype
exists compile time
values types
checked queried runtime
typing variables polymorphisms resolved compile time
polymorphism object oriented function calls
referred virtual functions
resolves call based type opposed supertypes variable allowed
variables store simple data
integers literal strings
programming languages variable store values datatypes
languages enable functions parametric polymorphic
functions operate variables represent data multiple types
function named length determine length list
length function parametric polymorphic including type variable type signature
amount elements list independent elements types
formal parameters functions referred variables
instance
python code segment
variable named parameter function called
integer argument
languages
function parameters local scope
specific variable named referred addtwo function
functions variables called
specifics variable allocation representation values vary widely
programming languages implementations language
language implementations allocate space local variables
extent lasts single function call call stack
memory automatically reclaimed function returns
generally
binding
variable bound address block
contiguous sequence
bytes memory
operations variable manipulate block
referencing common variables values large unknown sizes code compiled
variables reference location storing
allocated pool memory called heap
bound variables values
abstraction

represented data object
stored computer memory
program
runtime environment
set memory data object
memory finite
ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable
objects allocated heap objects longer needed
garbage collected language
java
lisp
runtime environment automatically reclaims objects extant variables longer refer
garbage collected languages
program
programmer
explicitly allocate memory
free
reclaim memory
failure leads memory leaks
heap depleted program runs
risks eventual failure exhausting memory
variable refers data structure created dynamically
components indirectly accessed variable
circumstances
garbage collectors
analogous program features languages lack garbage collectors
deal case portion memory reachable variable reclaimed
unlike mathematical counterparts
programming variables constants commonly multiple character names
cost total
single character names commonly auxiliary variables
instance
array index variables
naming conventions enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifiers
languages
variable names start digit
whitespace characters
punctuation marks permitted variable names varies language language
languages permit underscore
variable names forbid punctuation
programming languages
specific
punctuation
characters
sigils
prefixed appended variable identifiers variable type
case sensitivity variable names varies languages languages require case naming entities
note modern languages case sensitive
older languages
languages reserve forms variable names internal
languages
names beginning underscores
fall category
basic restrictions imposed language
naming variables largely matter style
machine code level
variable names
exact names chosen matter computer
names variables identify
rest tool programmers make programs easier write understand
poorly chosen variable names make code difficult review descriptive names
names clear encouraged
programmers create adhere code style guidelines offer guidance naming variables impose precise naming scheme
shorter names faster type descriptive
longer names make programs easier read purpose variables easier understand
extreme verbosity variable names lead comprehensible code
