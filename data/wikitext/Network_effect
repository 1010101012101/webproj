economic model defining
network effects significant subscription percentage achieved
called critical mass
critical mass point
obtained good service greater equal price paid good service
good determined user base
implies number people subscribed service purchased good
additional people subscribe service purchase good due exceeding price
key business concern attract users prior reaching critical mass
rely extrinsic motivation
payment

natural strategy build system network effects
early adopters
number users increases
system valuable attract wider user base
critical mass
increasing number subscribers generally continue indefinitely
point
networks congested saturated
stopping future uptake
congestion occurs due overuse
applicable analogy telephone network
number users congestion point
additional user adds additional customer
point addition extra user exceeds capacity existing system
point
additional user decreases obtained user
practical terms
additional user increases total system load
leading busy signals
inability dial tone
poor customer support
critical point obtained equals price paid
network cease grow point
system enlarged
congestion point larger market size
peer peer technological models defy congestion
peer peer systems
networks designed distribute load user pool
theoretically true networks scale indefinitely
