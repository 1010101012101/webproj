noise reduction easily achieved single listener remaining stationary multiple listeners single listener turns head moves space noise reduction challenge made difficult
high frequency waves difficult reduce dimensions due short audio wavelength air
wavelength air sinusoidal noise approximately double distance average person left ear ear
noise coming directly front easily reduced active system coming side tend cancel ear reinforced
making noise louder
softer
high frequency sounds tend cancel reinforce unpredictably directions
