bioaccumulates element manganese
postulated element plays role enzymatic breakdown gleba simultaneous formation odorous compounds
compounds dimethyl sulfide
aldehydes
contribute disagreeable odor produced enzymatic decarboxylation keto acids amino acids
enzymes work presence manganese
chemical analysis elemental composition gelatinous outer layer

stabilizes polysaccharide gel
protecting embryonic receptacle drying growth egg
