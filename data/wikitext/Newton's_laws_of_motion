original form
newton laws motion adequate characterize motion rigid bodies deformable bodies
leonard euler introduced generalization newton laws motion rigid bodies called euler laws motion
applied deformable bodies assumed continuum
body represented assemblage discrete particles
governed laws motion

laws
axioms describing laws motion extended bodies
independently particle structure
newton laws hold respect set frames reference called newtonian inertial reference frames
authors interpret law defining inertial reference frame
point view
law holds observation made inertial reference frame
law proved special case
authors treat law corollary
explicit concept inertial frame reference developed long newton death
interpretation mass
acceleration
momentum
importantly
force assumed externally defined quantities
common
interpretation laws definition quantities
newtonian mechanics superseded special relativity
approximation speeds involved slower speed light
law states net force
vector sum forces acting object
velocity object constant
velocity vector quantity expresses object speed direction motion
statement object velocity constant statement speed direction motion constant
law stated mathematically
object continues force exerted
rest
continues state rest
demonstrated tablecloth skillfully whipped dishes tabletop dishes remain initial state rest
object moving
continues move turning changing speed
evident space probes continually move outer space
motion imposed tendency object retain state motion
absence net forces
moving object move straight line path indefinitely
newton law motion establish frames reference laws applicable
law motion postulates existence frame reference called newtonian inertial reference frame
relative motion particle subject forces straight line constant speed
newton law referred law inertia
condition uniform motion particle relative inertial reference frame total net force acting
sense
law restated
newton laws valid inertial reference frame

aristotle view objects natural place universe
heavy objects
rocks
wanted rest earth light objects smoke wanted rest sky stars wanted remain heavens
thought body natural state rest
body move straight line constant speed external agent needed continually propel
stop moving
galileo galilei
realized force change velocity body
acceleration
force needed maintain velocity
words
galileo stated
absence force
moving object continue moving
tendency objects resist motion galileo called inertia
insight refined newton
made law
law inertia
force means acceleration
body maintain velocity
newton law restatement law inertia galileo
newton appropriately gave credit galileo
law inertia apparently occurred natural philosophers scientists independently
including thomas hobbes leviathan
century philosopher descartes formulated law
perform experiments confirm
law states net force object equal rate change
derivative
linear momentum inertial reference frame
law stated terms object acceleration
law valid constant mass systems
mass differentiation operator constant factor rule differentiation
net force applied
mass body
body acceleration
net force applied body produces proportional acceleration
words
body accelerating
force
consistent law
time derivative momentum momentum direction
change magnitude
case uniform circular motion
relationship implies conservation momentum
net force body
momentum body constant
net force equal rate change momentum
mass gained lost system change momentum result external force
equation variable mass systems
newton law requires modification effects special relativity account
high speeds approximation momentum product rest mass velocity accurate
impulse occurs force acts interval time
force time derivative momentum
relation impulse momentum closer newton wording law
impulse concept frequently analysis collisions impacts
variable mass systems
rocket burning fuel ejecting spent gases
closed directly treated making mass function time law
formula wrong
falsehood formula noting respect galilean invariance
variable mass object frame frame
correct equation motion body mass varies time ejecting accreting mass obtained applying law entire
constant mass system consisting body ejected
accreted mass
