practice fsf calls tivoization
majority free software licenses require modified software claim unmodified
licenses require copyright holders credited
version gnu gpl
requires interactive programs print warranty license information
notices removed modified versions intended distribution
licenses software packages contradictory requirements
render impossible combine source code packages order create software packages
license
modified versions mention developers advertising materials
license
modified versions additional attribution requirements
combined software package license software package
impossible distribute combination contradictory requirements simultaneously fulfilled
packages license incompatible
license proliferation compounds problems license incompatibility
likewise burdens software developers distributors increasing amount legal documents read
license proliferation gained momentum late increased early
year
identified problematic phenomenon gratuitous writing licenses frowned
restrictions private software
restrictions
generally unacceptable
examples include prohibiting software military purposes

bsd based distributions
fsf free software definition states development distribution restricted
commercial distribution free software acceptable common

main difference belief copyleft licenses
gnu general public license
gpl
undesirably complicated
restrictive
gpl requires derivative work released gpl bsd license
essentially
bsd license requirement acknowledge original authors
poses restrictions source code
result
bsd code proprietary software acknowledges authors
instance
stack microsoft windows
mac derived bsd licensed software
supporters bsd license argue free gpl grants source code
software public domain
includes incorporating bsd licensed code proprietary products
approach led bsd code common
widely proprietary software
response
supporters gpl licence claim free bsd licence prevents people incorporating gpl licensed code proprietary products
freedom make free software free software unjust form power freedom

gpl compatible
secure consent original authors
contrast
code gpl relicensed bsd license securing consent copyright holders
licenses compatible
combination distributed terms gpl
permissive license
existing free software bsds tend avoid including software licensed gpl core operating system
base system
resort alternatives existent vastly capable
gcc
note mid freebsd moving gcc upcoming llvm compiler
primarily reason
openbsd project acted remove gpl licensed tools favor bsd licensed alternatives
newly written adapted older code
debian project criteria laid debian free software guidelines

notable cases debian free software foundation disagree artistic license gnu free documentation license
gfdl
debian accepts original artistic license free software licence
fsf disagrees
impact artistic license dual license setup
gnu general public license
gnu free documentation license
debian decided apply dfsg distribution
including documentation
fsf argues documentation qualitatively software subject requirements
end result long discussion eventual vote debian works licensed gfdl considered free long unmodifiable sections

gnu documentation includes invariant sections
