Philosophy of space and time

philosophy space time
philosophy space time branch philosophy concerned issues surrounding ontology
epistemology
character space time
ideas central philosophy inception
philosophy space time inspiration central aspect early analytic philosophy
subject focuses number basic issues
including time space exist independently mind
exist independently
accounts time apparently unidirectional flow
times present moment exist
questions nature identity
nature identity time
earliest recorded western philosophy time expounded ancient egyptian thinker ptahhotep
bce
lessen time desire
wasting time abomination spirit

earliest texts indian philosophy hindu philosophy
dating back late millennium bce

universe repeated cycles creation

traditional realist position ontology time space existence human mind
idealists
contrast
deny doubt existence objects independent mind
anti realists
ontological position objects mind exist
doubt independent existence time space
immanuel kant published critique pure reason
influential works history philosophy space time
describes time priori notion
priori notions space
comprehend sense experience
kant denies space time substance
entities
learned experience

spatial measurements quantify objects
temporal measurements quantitatively compare interval

space time held transcendentally ideal sense
empirically
mere illusions
idealist writers
mctaggart unreality time

arguing absolutist position
leibniz offers number thought experiments purpose showing contradiction assuming existence facts absolute location velocity
arguments trade heavily principles central philosophy
principle sufficient reason identity indiscernibles
principle sufficient reason holds fact
reason sufficient explain
identity indiscernibles states telling entities
thing
leibniz involves proposed universes situated absolute space
discernible difference positioned feet left
thing absolute space exists
situation
leibniz
universe position absolute space sufficient reason
contradicts principle sufficient reason

response leibniz arguments bucket argument
water bucket
hung rope set spin
start flat surface
water begins spin bucket
surface water concave
bucket stopped
water continue spin
spin continues surface remain concave
concave surface apparently result interaction bucket water
water flat bucket starts spin
concave water starts spin
remains concave bucket stops
response
clarke argues necessity existence absolute space account phenomena rotation acceleration accounted purely relationalist account
clarke argues curvature water occurs rotating bucket stationary bucket spinning water
explained stating water rotating relation presence space
leibniz describes space exists relation objects
existence existence objects
motion exists relation objects
newtonian space provided absolute frame reference objects motion
newton system
frame reference exists independently objects contained
objects moving relation space
centuries
evidence concave water surface held authority
important figure debate century physicist ernst mach
deny existence phenomena bucket argument
denied absolutist conclusion offering answer bucket rotating relation
fixed stars
mach suggested thought experiments bucket argument problematic
imagine universe bucket
newton account
bucket set spin relative absolute space
water contained form characteristic concave surface
absence universe
difficult confirm bucket spinning
equally surface water bucket remain flat
mach argued
effect
water experiment empty universe remain flat
object introduced universe
distant star
relative bucket rotating
water inside bucket possibly slight curve
account curve observe
increase number objects universe increases curvature water
mach argued momentum object
angular linear
exists result sum effects objects universe
mach principle
albert einstein proposed relativistics based principle relativity
theory holds rules physics observers
frame reference
light propagates speed reference frames
theory motivated maxwell equations
show electromagnetic waves propagate vacuum speed light
maxwell equations give indication speed relative
prior einstein
thought speed relative fixed medium
called luminiferous ether
contrast
theory special relativity postulates light propagates speed light inertial frames
examines implications postulate
attempts measure speed relative ether failed
confirmation einstein postulate light propagates speed reference frames
special relativity formalization principle relativity privileged inertial frame reference
luminiferous ether absolute space
einstein inferred frame exists
einstein generalized relativity frames reference inertial
achieved positing equivalence principle
states force felt observer gravitational field felt observer accelerating frame reference indistinguishable
led conclusion mass object warps geometry space time surrounding
einstein field equations
classical physics
inertial reference frame object experiences forces accelerate
general relativity
inertial frame reference geodesic space time
object moves geodesic experiences force
object free fall experience force
geodesic
object standing earth
experience force
held geodesic surface planet
light
bucket water rotating empty space experience force rotates respect geodesic
water concave
rotating respect distant stars
rotating respect geodesic
einstein partially advocates mach principle distant stars explain inertia provide gravitational field acceleration inertia occur
contrary leibniz account
