vocoder examines speech measuring spectral characteristics change time
results series signals representing modified frequencies time user speaks
simple terms
signal split number frequency bands
larger number
accurate analysis
level signal present frequency band instantaneous representation spectral energy content
vocoder dramatically reduces amount information needed store speech
complete recording series numbers
recreate speech
vocoder simply reverses process
processing broadband noise source passing stage filters frequency content based originally recorded series numbers
information instantaneous frequency
distinct spectral characteristic
original voice signal discarded
important preserve purposes vocoder original encryption aid
dehumanizing
quality vocoding process made creating special voice effects popular music audio entertainment
