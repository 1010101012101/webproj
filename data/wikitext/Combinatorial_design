Combinatorial design

combinatorial design
combinatorial design theory part combinatorial mathematics deals existence
construction properties systems finite sets arrangements satisfy generalized concepts balance
symmetry
concepts made precise wide range objects thought umbrella
times involve numerical sizes set intersections block designs
times involve spatial arrangement entries array sudoku grids
combinatorial design theory applied area design experiments
basic theory combinatorial designs originated statistician ronald fisher work design biological experiments
modern applications found wide gamut areas including
finite geometry
tournament scheduling
lotteries
mathematical biology
algorithm design analysis
networking
group testing cryptography
