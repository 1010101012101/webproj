wood ancient structures matched chronologies
technique called cross dating
age wood determined precisely
cross dating originally visual inspection
computers harnessed statistical matching
eliminate individual variations tree ring growth
dendrochronologists smoothed average tree ring widths multiple tree samples build ring history
process termed replication
