recommended procedure involves drying boiling mushrooms
boiling fresh mushrooms directly
prepare fresh mushroom recommended cut small pieces parboiled copious amounts water
parts water part chopped mushrooms
minutes
boiling mushroom rinsed clean water
round parboiling reduces gyromitrin contents tenth
gyromitrin leached water remain
parboiling water discarded replaced fresh water round boiling
drying mushrooms reduce concentration gyromitrin
ten days open air desiccation leads loss gyromitrin
recommended mushroom boiled drying
mmh boils
readily vaporizes air water fresh false morels boiled
poorly ventilated spaces vapor accumulate
resulting gyromitrin poisoning
boiling mushrooms indoors
care ensure adequate ventilation
symptoms gyromitrin poisoning
immediately seek fresh air
boiling
small amounts gyromitrin remain mushrooms
possibility accumulation toxins
repeated consumption recommended
strains lower concentrations gyromitrin discovered
fungus successfully grown fruiting culture
scope future research cultivation safer strains
