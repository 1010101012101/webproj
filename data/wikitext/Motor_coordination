problem understanding motor coordination arises biomechanical redundancy caused large number musculoskeletal elements involved
elements create degrees freedom action range ways arranging
turning
extending combining muscles
joints
limbs motor task
hypotheses developed explanation nervous system determines solution large set solutions accomplish task motor goals equally
nikolai bernstein proposed existence muscle synergies neural strategy simplifying control multiple degrees freedom
functional muscle synergy defined pattern activation muscles recruited single neural command signal
muscle part multiple muscle synergies
synergy activate multiple muscles
current method finding muscle synergies measure emg
electromyography
signals muscles involved movement specific patterns muscle activation identified
muscle synergies combined proportions form continuum muscle activation pattern smooth motor control tasks
synergies work movements walking balance control perturbation applied
directionality movement effect motor task performed
walking forward
walking backward
levels contraction muscles
researchers measure emg signals perturbation applied multiple directions order identify muscle synergies present
initially
thought muscle synergies eliminated redundant degrees freedom constraining movements joints muscles
shown constraining movement joints muscles requires energy neural commands
increases number neural signals required perform task
recent hypothesis propose central nervous system eliminate redundant degrees freedom
ensure flexible stable performance motor tasks
central nervous system makes abundance redundant systems restricting previously hypothesized

differently stated
synergy represents organization elemental variables
degrees freedom
stabilizes important performance variable
elemental variable smallest variable describe system interest selected level analysis
performance variable refers potentially important variables produced system
multi joint reaching task
angles positions joints elemental variables
performance variables endpoint coordinates hand
hypothesis proposes controller
brain
acts space elemental variables
rotations shared shoulder
elbow
wrist arm movements
selects space manifolds
sets angular values final position
hypothesis acknowledges variability present human movements
categorizes types
bad variability
good variability
bad variability affects important performance variable large errors final result motor task
good variability performance task unchanged maintains successful outcome
suggests brain works decrease bad variability hinders desired final result
increasing good variability redundant domain

contrast model
joint space model postulates motor system plans movements joint coordinates
model
controlled parameter position joint contributing movement
control strategies goal directed movement differ task subject assigned
proven testing conditions
subjects moved cursor hand target
subjects move free hand target
