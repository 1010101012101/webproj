nuclear weapons tests historically broken categories reflecting medium location test
separately designations
nuclear tests categorized purpose test
technical considerations
tests conducted political training purposes
tests serve multiple purposes
hydronuclear tests study nuclear materials conditions explosive shock compression
create critical conditions
supercritical conditions yields ranging negligible substantial fraction full weapon yield
critical mass experiments determine quantity fissile material required criticality variety fissile material compositions

problem
weapon generated large amount radioactive nuclear fallout
anticipated
change weather pattern caused fallout spread direction cleared advance
fallout plume spread high levels radiation hundred miles
contaminating number populated islands nearby atoll formations
evacuated
islands inhabitants suffered radiation burns effects increased cancer rate birth defects
