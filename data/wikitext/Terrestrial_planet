uncompressed density terrestrial planet average density materials pressure
greater uncompressed density greater metal content
uncompressed density differs true average density compression planet cores increases density
average density depends planet size composition
densities solar terrestrial planets
moon
largest asteroids shown
densities generally trend lower values distance sun increases
main exception rule density moon
owes lesser density unusual origin
unknown extrasolar terrestrial planets general follow trend
