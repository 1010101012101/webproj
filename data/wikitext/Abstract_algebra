phrase abstract algebra coined turn century distinguish area referred algebra
study rules manipulating formulae algebraic expressions involving unknowns real complex numbers
called elementary algebra
distinction rarely made recent writings
contemporary mathematics mathematical physics make extensive abstract algebra
theoretical physics draws lie algebras
subject areas algebraic number theory
algebraic topology
algebraic geometry apply algebraic methods areas mathematics
representation theory
roughly speaking
takes abstract abstract algebra
studying concrete side structure
model theory
mathematical subject areas study properties algebraic structures viewed universal algebra category theory
algebraic structures
homomorphisms
form categories
category theory powerful formalism studying comparing algebraic structures
parts mathematics
concrete problems examples played important roles development algebra
end nineteenth century
problems related theory algebraic equations
major themes include
numerous textbooks abstract algebra start axiomatic definitions algebraic structures proceed establish properties
creates false impression algebra axioms served motivation basis study
true order historical development opposite
hypercomplex numbers nineteenth century kinematic physical motivations challenged comprehension
theories recognized parts algebra started collections disparate facts branches mathematics
acquired common theme served core results grouped
finally unified basis common set concepts
archetypical progressive synthesis history group theory
threads early development group theory
modern language loosely number theory
theory equations
geometry
leonhard euler considered algebraic operations numbers modulo integer
modular arithmetic
generalization fermat theorem

considered structure multiplicative groups residues mod established properties cyclic general abelian groups arise
investigations composition binary quadratic forms
gauss explicitly stated associative law composition forms
