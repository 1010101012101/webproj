keto enol tautomerism occurs keto enol deprotonated anion
called enolate
formed intermediate
enolates exist quantitative amounts strictly acid free conditions
generally basic
enolates anionic charge delocalized oxygen carbon
enolates stabilized delocalization charge atoms
valence bond theory
commonly employed organic chemistry
explained phenomenon resonance
enolate ion delocalized bond
represented valence bond theory resonance hybrid
molecular orbital theory represented delocalized molecular orbitals

enediols carbonyl group adjacent enediol group called reductones
enediol structure stabilized resonance resulting tautomerism adjacent carbonyl
chemical equilibrium produces enediol form keto form
reductones strong reducing agents
efficacious antioxidants
fairly strong acids
