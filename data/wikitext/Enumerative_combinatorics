enumerative combinatorics area combinatorics deals number ways patterns formed
examples type problem counting combinations counting permutations
generally
infinite collection finite sets indexed natural numbers
enumerative combinatorics seeks describe counting function counts number objects
counting number elements set broad mathematical problem
problems arise applications simple combinatorial description
twelvefold unified framework counting permutations
combinations partitions
simplest functions closed formulas
expressed composition elementary functions factorials

number orderings deck cards
closed form initially
cases
frequently derive recurrence relation
solve recurrence arrive desired closed form
finally
expressed formal power series
called generating function
commonly ordinary generating function
exponential generating function
complicated closed formula yields insight behavior counting function number counted objects grows

operations enumerate common combinatorial objects including trees
binary plane
dyck paths cycles
combinatorial structure composed atoms
trees atoms nodes
atoms compose object labeled unlabeled
unlabeled atoms indistinguishable
labelled atoms distinct
combinatorial object consisting labeled atoms object formed simply swapping atoms
binary plane trees examples unlabeled combinatorial structure
trees consist nodes linked edges cycles
generally node called root
parent node
