leftward moving particle collides rightward moving
annihilate
leaving fewer particles system
type ballistic annihilation process occurs cellular automata related systems

remains stationary
collision moving stationary particle results single moving particle moving opposite direction
random initial configurations tend stabilize quickly forming trivial long range dynamics

cellular automaton generates general types patterns sequentially
random initial conditions sufficiently large grids
field purely random
cells consume neighbors range consumed higher ranking cells
automaton consuming phase
blocks color advancing remaining blocks randomness
important development objects called demons
cycles adjacent cells cell state

cell automaton eventually enters repeating cycle states
period repetition
automata odd von neumann neighborhood
eventually period behavior occurs higher dimensions
small structures constructed period
merging structures

larger neighborhoods
similar spiraling behavior occurs low thresholds
sufficiently high thresholds automaton stabilizes block color stage forming spirals
intermediate values threshold
complex mix color blocks partial spirals
called turbulence
