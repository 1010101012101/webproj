agaricus deserticola
commonly gasteroid agaricus
species fungus agaricaceae family
found southwestern western north america
adapted growth dry semi arid habitats
fruit bodies secotioid
meaning spores forcibly discharged
cap fully expand
unlike agaricus species
develop true gills
convoluted networked system spore producing tissue called gleba
partial veil breaks pulls stem cap splits radially
blackish brown gleba exposed
spores dispersed
