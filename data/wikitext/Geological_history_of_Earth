tectonic style
time
earth crust cooled rocks continental plates began form
scientists earth hotter
plate tectonic activity vigorous today
resulting greater rate recycling crustal material
prevented cratonisation continent formation mantle cooled convection slowed
argue subcontinental lithospheric mantle buoyant subduct lack archean rocks function erosion subsequent tectonic events
contrast proterozoic
archean rocks heavily metamorphized deep water sediments
graywackes
mudstones
volcanic sediments banded iron formations
greenstone belts typical archean formations
consisting alternating high low grade metamorphic rocks
high grade rocks derived volcanic island arcs
low grade metamorphic rocks represent deep sea sediments eroded neighboring island arcs deposited forearc basin
