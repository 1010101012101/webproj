advent midi atari
programmers write software record play back notes played musician
unlike early sequencers play mechanical sounding sequence equal length
recorded played back expressive performances real musicians
typically control external synthesizers
rackmounted sound modules longer synthesizer keyboard
technology matured
sequencers gained features
integrated ability record multitrack audio
sequencers audio called digital audio workstations
daws
modern sequencers control virtual instruments implemented software plug ins
allowing musicians replace separate synthesizers software equivalents
today term
sequencer
describe software
hardware sequencers exist
workstation keyboards proprietary built midi sequencers
drum machines older synthesizers step sequencer built
standalone hardware midi sequencers
market demand diminished greatly due greater feature set software counterparts
