Tropical year

tropical year
tropical year
solar year
general purposes
length time sun takes return position cycle seasons
earth
time vernal equinox vernal equinox
summer solstice summer solstice
precession equinoxes
seasonal cycle remain synchronized position earth orbit sun
consequence
tropical year minutes shorter time takes earth complete full orbit sun measured respect fixed stars
sidereal year
antiquity
astronomers progressively refined definition tropical year
define time required sun tropical longitude
longitudinal position ecliptic relative position vernal equinox
increase degrees
complete full seasonal circuit
