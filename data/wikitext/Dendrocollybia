dendrocollybia genus fungus family tricholomataceae order agaricales
monotypic genus
single species dendrocollybia racemosa
commonly branched collybia branched shanklet
rare species found northern hemisphere
including pacific northwest region western north america
europe
included regional red lists
grows decaying fruit bodies lactarius host mushrooms decayed point difficult recognize
dendrocollybia racemosa fruit bodies small pale grayish white grayish brown caps
wide
thin stems
long
species characterized unusual stem
covered short lateral branches
branches produce spherical slimeheads translucent conidiophores swollen tips
conidiophores produce conidia
asexual spores
mitosis
fungus rely sexual asexual modes reproduction
fruit bodies reduced missing caps
unusual stems originate black pea sized structures called sclerotia
anamorphic form fungus
tilachlidiopsis racemosa
missing sexual stage life cycle
reproduce low temperatures
adaptation believed improve ability grow quickly fruit decomposing mushrooms
