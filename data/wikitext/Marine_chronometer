find longitude
needed time standard work aboard ship
observation regular celestial motions
galileo method based observing jupiter natural satellites
sea due ship motion
lunar distance method
initially proposed johannes werner
developed parallel marine chronometer
dutch scientist gemma frisius propose chronometer determine longitude
purpose chronometer measure accurately time fixed location
greenwich time
gmt
important navigation
knowing gmt local noon navigator time difference ship position greenwich meridian determine ship longitude
earth rotates regular rate
time difference chronometer ship local time calculate longitude ship relative greenwich meridian
defined
spherical trigonometry
modern practice

escapement serves purposes
train advance fractionally record balance oscillations
time
supplies minute amounts energy counter tiny losses friction
maintaining momentum oscillating balance
escapement part ticks
natural resonance oscillating balance serves heart chronometer
chronometer escapements designed interfere balance
constant force detached escapement designs
common spring detent pivoted detent
small detent locks escape wheel balance swing completely free interference moment centre oscillation
susceptible influences
centre oscillation
roller balance staff momentarily displaces detent
allowing tooth escape wheel pass
escape wheel tooth imparts energy roller balance staff
escape wheel turns direction
balance receives impulse direction
return oscillation
passing spring tip detent unlocking roller staff move displacing detent
weakest link mechanical timekeeper escapement lubrication
oil thickens age temperature
dissipates humidity evaporation
rate change
dramatically balance motion decreases higher friction escapement
detent escapement strong advantage escapements lubrication
impulse escape wheel impulse roller dead beat
meaning sliding action needing lubrication
chronometer escape wheels passing springs typically gold due metal lower slide friction brass steel
