term coined tim berners lee
inventor world wide web director world wide web consortium

defines semantic web
web data processed directly indirectly machines
technologies proposed existed positioned umbrella
contexts
dealing information encompasses limited defined domain
sharing data common necessity

microformats represent unofficial attempts extend html syntax create machine readable semantic markup objects retail stores items sale
semantic web takes solution
involves publishing languages specifically designed data
resource description framework
rdf
web ontology language
owl
extensible markup language
xml
html describes documents links
rdf
owl
xml
contrast
describe arbitrary things people
meetings
airplane parts
technologies combined order provide descriptions supplement replace content web documents
content manifest descriptive data stored web accessible databases
markup documents
extensible html
xhtml
interspersed xml
purely xml
layout rendering cues stored separately
machine readable descriptions enable content managers add meaning content
describe structure knowledge content
machine process knowledge
text
processes similar human deductive reasoning inference
obtaining meaningful results helping computers perform automated information gathering research
