bow consists stick hairs stretched ends
bowing instrument string stick slip phenomenon occur
makes string vibrate
ancestors modern bowed string instruments rebab islamic empires
persian kamanche byzantine lira
bowed ins
hardingfele
nyckelharpa
errde effects
common method sound production stringed instruments strike string
piano method sound production
violin family string instrument players occasionally instructed strike string side bow
technique called col legno
yields percussive sound pitch note
col legno orchestral strings gustav holst
mars
movement planets suite
aeolian harp employs unusual method sound production
strings excited movement air
instruments strings attached keyboards player directly manipulating strings
include piano
clavichord
harpsichord
keyboard instruments
strings occasionally plucked bowed hand
composers henry cowell wrote music asks player reach inside piano pluck strings directly
bow
bow hair wrapped strings
play rolling bell brass instrument trombone array strings
keyed string instruments
small strolling musician play
include plucked autoharp
bowed nyckelharpa
hurdy gurdy
played cranking rosined wheel
steel stringed instruments
guitar
bass
violin
played magnetic field
bow small hand held battery powered device excite strings electric guitar
sustained
singing tone string magnetically vibrated
bridge plucking method string divided pieces struck side unamplified
technique electric instruments
pickup amplifies local string vibration
acoustic instruments
lesser convenient
instance press fret guitar pluck head side tone resonate opposed part
electric instruments technique generate multitone sounds remniscent clock bell
threecitation needed ways change pitch vibrating string
string instruments tuned varying strings tension adjusting length mass unit length impractical
instruments fingerboard played adjusting length vibrating portion strings
observations apply string infinitely flexible strung fixed supports
real strings finite curvature bridge nut
bridge
motion
nodes vibration
statements proportionality
good
approximations
pitch adjusted varying length string
longer string result lower pitch
shorter string result higher pitch
frequency inversely proportional length
string long produce tone half frequency
octave lower
pitch adjusted varying tension string
string tension
looser
result lower pitch
string greater tension
tighter
result higher pitch
frequency proportional square root tension
pitch string varied changing linear density
mass unit length
stringcitation needed
frequency inversely proportional square root linear density
string higher mass unit length produce lower pitch
length string nut bridge bowed plucked instruments ultimately determines distance notes instrument
double bass low range scale length inches
whilst violin scale inches
shorter scale violin
left hand easily reach range slightly octaves shifting position
bass longer scale
single octave ninth reachable lower positions
bowed instruments
bow perpendicularly string
point half end fingerboard bridge
bow placements selected change timbre
application bow close bridge
sul ponticello
produces intense
harsh sound
acoustically emphasizes upper harmonics
bowing fingerboard
sul tasto
produces purer tone overtone strength
emphasizing fundamental
flautando
sounds reedy flute
similar timbral distinctions plucked string instruments selecting plucking point
difference subtle
keyboard instruments
contact point string
hammer
tangent
plectrum
choice made instrument designer
builders combination experience acoustic theory establish set contact points
harpsichords
sets strings equal length
choirs
differ plucking points
choir
normal
plucking point
producing canonical harpsichord sound
plucking point close bridge
producing reedier
nasal
sound rich upper harmonics
string tension length produce note
obtain multiple notes
string instruments employ methods
add strings cover range notes desired
strings stopped
piano harp examples method
note instrument string multiple strings
notes piano strung
choir
strings tuned alike
zithers combine stoppable
melody
strings greater number
open
harmony chord strings
instruments stoppable strings
violin guitar
player shorten vibrating length string
fingers directly
rarely mechanical device
nyckelharpa hurdy gurdy
instruments fingerboard attached neck instrument
hard flat surface athe player stop strings
string instruments
fingerboard frets
raised ridges perpendicular strings stop string precise intervals
case fingerboard called fretboard
moving frets performance impractical
bridges koto
hand
moved player
occasionally single piece music
modern western harps include levers
directly moved fingers
celtic harps
controlled foot pedals
orchestral harps
raise pitch individual strings fixed amount
middle eastern zither
qanun
equipped small levers called mandal multiple strings incrementally retuned
fly
instrument played
levers raise lower pitch string microtone
half step
instruments employed sympathetic strings
additional strings meant plucked
strings resonate played notes

sound strings
technically speaking
amplification occurs
energy produce sound vibrating string
sounding board instrument larger surface area create sound waves string
larger vibrating surface moves air
produces louder sound
lute type instruments traditionally bridge
holds string proper action height fret
finger board
acoustic instruments
bridge performs equally important function transmitting string energy

electronic amplification
string instruments fitted piezoelectric magnetic pickups convert string vibrations electrical signal amplified converted back sound loudspeakers
players attach pickup traditional string instrument
electrify
option solid bodied instrument
reduces unwanted feedback howls squeals
amplified string instruments louder acoustic counterparts
loud rock
