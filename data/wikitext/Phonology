Phonology

phonology
phonology branch linguistics concerned systematic organization sounds languages
traditionally focused largely study systems phonemes languages
cover linguistic analysis level beneath word
including syllable
onset rhyme
articulatory gestures
articulatory features
mora
levels language sound considered structured conveying linguistic meaning
phonology includes study equivalent organizational systems sign languages

underlying representation surface phonetic representation
ordered phonological rules govern underlying representation transformed actual pronunciation
called surface form
