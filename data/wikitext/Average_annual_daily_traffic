traffic data collected automated traffic counter hiring observer record traffic
techniques measuring aadts road segments
technique called continuous count data collection method
sensors permanently embedded road traffic data measured days

installing maintaining continuous count stations method costly
agencies monitor small percentage roadway method
aadts generated short term data collection methods coverage count data collection method
traffic collected portable sensors attached road record traffic data typically days
typically pneumatic road tubes expensive technology radar
laser
sonar exist
recording traffic data
traffic counts road segment years
fhwa traffic monitoring guide recommends performing short count road segment minimum years
methods calculate aadt short term count
methods attempt remove seasonal day week biases collection period applying factors created continuous counters
