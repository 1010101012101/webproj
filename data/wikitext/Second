today
atomic clock operating microwave region challenged atomic clocks operating optical region
quote ludlow
recent years
optical atomic clocks increasingly competitive performance microwave counterparts
accuracy single trapped ion based optical standards closely approaches state art caesium fountain standards
large ensembles ultracold alkaline earth atoms provided impressive clock stability short averaging times
surpassing single ion based systems
interrogation neutral atom based optical standards carried primarily free space
unavoidably including atomic motional effects typically limit system accuracy
alternative approach explore ultranarrow optical transitions atoms held optical lattice
atoms tightly localized doppler photon recoil related effects transition frequency eliminated
