term computer security refers technology implement secure operating system
technology based science developed produce impenetrable operating systems
valid
technology limited today
primarily imposes system management widely understood
ultra strong secure operating systems based operating system kernel technology guarantee security policies absolutely enforced operating environment
computer security policy bell lapadula model
strategy based coupling special microprocessor hardware features
involving memory management unit
special correctly implemented operating system kernel
forms foundation secure operating system
critical parts designed implemented correctly
ensure absolute impossibility penetration hostile elements
capability enabled configuration imposes security policy
theory completely protects corruption
ordinary operating systems
