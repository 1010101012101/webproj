combinatorial mathematics
problem des asks number ways seat set male female couples dining table men women alternate sits partner
problem formulated lucas independently
years earlier
peter guthrie tait connection knot theory
number couples equal
number seating arrangements
mathematicians developed formulas recurrence equations computing numbers related sequences numbers
applications etiquette knot theory
numbers graph theoretic interpretation
count numbers matchings hamiltonian cycles families graphs
denote number seating arrangements couples
touchard
derived formula
subsequent work alternative proofs formula generalized versions problem count seating arrangements couples permitted sit
formula involving chebyshev polynomials wyman moser
work bogart doyle
solutions problem form finding seating arrangements women counting
partial seating arrangements
number ways completing seating men wives
bogart doyle showed
touchard formula directly derived seating arrangements factoring participation women
ways seating women
choices set seats place women
choices place set seats
seating arrangement women
ways seating men
formula simply omits
factor touchard formula
resulting sequence smaller numbers
starting
called sequence numbers
satisfy recurrence relation
simpler term recurrence
numbers easily calculated
solutions problem interpreted graph theoretic terms
directed hamiltonian cycles crown graphs
crown graph formed removing perfect matching complete bipartite graph
vertices colors
vertex color connected vertices color
case problem
vertices graph represent men women
edges represent pairs men women allowed sit
graph formed removing perfect matching formed male female couples complete bipartite graph connects man woman
valid seating arrangement sequence people order table
forms hamiltonian cycle graph
hamiltonian cycles considered equivalent connect vertices cyclic order starting vertex
problem starting position considered significant

graph theoretic description problem
women seated
seating arrangements remaining men perfect matchings graph formed removing single hamiltonian cycle complete bipartite graph
graph edges connecting open seats men
removal cycle corresponds forbidding men sit open seats adjacent wives
problem counting matchings bipartite graph
fortiori problem computing numbers
solved permanents matrices
case problem
matrices arising view problem circulant matrices
tait motivation studying problem find complete listing mathematical knots number crossings
dowker notation knot diagrams
early form tait
points knot knots crosses
consecutive order knot
labeled numbers
reduced diagram
labels crossing consecutive
set pairs labels crossing
dowker notation represent knot
interpreted perfect matching graph vertex number range edge pair numbers parity consecutive modulo
graph formed removing hamiltonian cycle
connecting consecutive numbers
complete bipartite graph
connecting pairs numbers parity
number matchings equal number
alternating knots
matching describe knot diagram
knots
additional positive negative sign crossing pair determine strands crossing lies strand
knot listing problem additional symmetries present problem
obtains dowker notations knot diagram begins labeling crossing point
notations counted representing diagram
reason
matchings differ cyclic permutation treated equivalent counted
gilbert
solved modified enumeration problem
showing number matchings
