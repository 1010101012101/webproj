release basic functionality php today
included perl variables

development team began form
months work beta testing
officially released php
november

july
php released
powered zend engine
php included features improved support object oriented programming
php data objects
pdo
extension
defines lightweight consistent interface accessing databases
numerous performance enhancements
php stable version development
late static binding missing php added version
major version development alongside php years
version originally planned released php result significant
included plans full unicode support
unicode support developers longer implement originally thought
decision made march move project branch
features development moved trunk
code include removal register globals
magic quotes
safe mode
reason removals register globals opened security holes intentionally allowing runtime data injection
magic quotes unpredictable nature
escape characters
magic quotes replaced addslashes
function
appropriately escape mechanism specific database vendor mysql real escape string
mysql
functions removed future versions deprecated php
produce warning
high profile open source projects ceased support php code february
initiative
provided consortium php developers promoting transition php php
