firestorm created result stack effect heat original fire draws surrounding air
draft quickly increased low level jet stream exists fire
updraft mushrooms
strong gusty winds develop fire
directed supply fire additional air
prevent firestorm spreading wind
tremendous turbulence created strong surface inflow winds change direction erratically
wind shear capable producing small tornado dust devil circulations called fire whirls dart erratically
damage destroy houses buildings
quickly spread fire areas central area fire

firestorm develop mesocyclone induce true tornadoes
true peshtigo fire
greater draft firestorm draws greater quantities oxygen
significantly increases combustion
substantially increasing production heat

firestorms appreciably ignite material distance ahead
formation firestorm fires merge form single convective column hot gases rising burning area strong
fire induced
radial
inwardly directed
winds convective column
fire front essentially stationary outward spread fire prevented rushing wind
fire storm characterized strong gale force winds blowing fire
fire perimeter
effect caused buoyancy rising column hot gases intense mass fire
drawing cool air periphery
winds perimeter blow fire brands burning area tend cool unignited fuel fire area ignition material periphery radiated heat fire embers difficult
limiting fire spread
large wildfire conflagrations distinct firestorms
crucially
moving fire fronts driven ambient wind develop wind system true firestorms
conflagrations develop single ignition
firestorms observed large numbers fires burning simultaneously large area
important caveat density simultaneously burning fires firestorm needing critical mass firestorm form
notable case large numbers fires burning simultaneously large area firestorm developing kuwaiti oil fires due distance individual fire large
enormous ash cloud produced firestorm
