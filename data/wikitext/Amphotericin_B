formulations developed improve tolerability patient
show considerably pharmacokinetic characteristics compared plain amphotericin
natural route synthesis includes polyketide synthase components
oral preparations amphotericin treat thrush
virtually nontoxic
contrast typical intravenous therapy
doses
main intravenous treating systemic fungal infections
critically
comorbidly infected immunocompromised patients
including cryptococcal meningitis
amphotericin commonly tissue culture prevent fungi contaminating cell cultures
sold concentrated solution
combination antibiotics penicillin streptomycin
drug resort untreatable parasitic protozoan infections visceral leishmaniasis primary amoebic meningoencephalitis
polyene antifungals
amphotericin binds ergosterol
component fungal cell membranes
forming transmembrane channel leads monovalent ion
leakage
primary effect leading fungal cell death
recently
researchers found evidence pore formation necessarily linked cell death actual mechanism action complex multifaceted
mammalian fungal membranes sterols
primary membrane target amphotericin
mammalian fungal membranes similar structure composition
mechanism amphotericin cellular toxicity
amphotericin molecules form pores host membrane fungal membrane
impairment membrane barrier function lethal effects
bacteria affected cell membrane sterols
amphotericin administration limited infusion related toxicity
thought result innate immune production proinflammatory cytokines
amphotericin severe potentially lethal side effects
