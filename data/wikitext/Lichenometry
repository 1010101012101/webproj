lichenometry geomorphic method geochronologic aging lichen growth determine age exposed rock
lichens presumed increase size radially specific rates grow
measuring diameter largest lichen species rock surface determine amount time rock exposed

differences lichen measured
suggest largest diameter measured
scientists prefer diameter largest inscribed circle
problem dating lichens fact thalli fuse
making minor lichens appears larger older age
