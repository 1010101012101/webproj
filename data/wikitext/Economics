microeconomics examines market structures
perfect competition describes market structure participants large market power set price homogeneous product
putting perfectly competitive market exists participant
price taker
participant influences price product buys sells
imperfect competition refers market structures conditions perfect competition exist
forms imperfect competition include
monopoly
seller good
duopoly
sellers good
oligopoly
sellers good
monopolistic competition
sellers producing highly differentiated goods
monopsony
buyer good
oligopsony

unlike perfect competition
imperfect competition invariably means market power unequally distributed
firms imperfect competition potential
