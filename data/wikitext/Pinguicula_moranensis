mucilaginous glands sessile
flat
digestive glands
peduncular glands consist secretory cells top single celled stalk
cells produce mucilaginous secretion forms visible droplets leaf surface
wet appearance helps lure prey search water
similar phenomenon observed sundews
droplets secrete limited enzymes serve entrap insects
contact insect
peduncular glands release additional mucilage special reservoir cells located base stalks
insect struggles
triggering glands encasing mucilage
moranensis bend leaf edges slightly thigmotropism
bringing additional glands contact trapped insect
sessile glands
lie flat leaf surface
serve digest insect prey
prey entrapped peduncular glands digestion begins
initial flow nitrogen triggers enzyme release sessile glands
enzymes
include amylase
esterase
phosphatase
protease
ribonuclease break digestible components insect body
fluids absorbed back leaf surface cuticular holes
leaving chitin exoskeleton larger insects leaf surface
holes cuticle digestive mechanism pose challenge plant
serve breaks cuticle
waxy layer
protects plant desiccation
result
moranensis found humid environments
production stalked capture glands sessile digestive glands costly
recent study found density respective glands correlated environmental gradients
capture gland density found highest prey availability low
digestive glands density showed direct correlation prey availability
results suggest amount investment carnivorous features adaptation environmental gradients
