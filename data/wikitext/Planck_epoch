physical cosmology
planck epoch
planck era
earliest period time history universe
approximately seconds
planck time
believed
due extraordinary small scale universe time
quantum effects gravity dominated physical interactions
point approximately
billion years ago force gravity believed strong fundamental forces
hints possibility forces unified
inconceivably hot dense
state universe planck epoch unstable
tending evolve
giving rise familiar manifestations fundamental forces process symmetry breaking
theorized earliest moment time meaningfully
modern cosmology suggests planck epoch inaugurated period unification
grand unification epoch
symmetry breaking quickly led era cosmic inflation
inflationary epoch
universe greatly expanded scale short period time
presently exists widely accepted framework combine quantum mechanics relativistic gravity
science make predictions events occurring intervals shorter planck time distances shorter planck length
distance light travels planck
meters
understanding quantum gravity
theory unifying quantum mechanics relativistic gravity
physics planck epoch unclear
exact manner fundamental forces unified
separate entities
poorly understood
forces successfully integrated common framework
gravity remains problematic
quantum effects
universe starts singularity infinite density
conclusion change quantum gravity account
string theory loop quantum gravity leading candidates theory unification
yielded meaningful insights
work noncommutative geometry fields holds promise understanding beginning
experimental data casting light cosmological epoch scant existent
recent results wmap probe allowed scientists test hypotheses universe trillionth
cosmic microwave background radiation observed wmap originated universe hundred thousand years
interval orders magnitude longer planck time
experiments coming online including planck surveyor probe
promise push back cosmic clock reveal bit moments universe history
giving insight planck epoch
data particle accelerators meaningful insight early universe
experiments relativistic heavy ion collider allowed physicists determine plasma
early phase matter
behaved liquid gas
large hadron collider cern probe earlier phases matter
accelerator
current planned
capable probing planck scale directly
