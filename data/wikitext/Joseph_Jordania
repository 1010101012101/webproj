shift human communication articulated speech
jordania happened populations epochs
choral singing lost primary survival importance started disappear
jordania promotes idea music
universal elements contemporary human culture
including dance body painting
result forces natural selection
sexual selection
suggested rhythmic loud singing drumming
threatening rhythmic body movements body painting
core element ancient audio visual intimidating display
scare predators
primarily lions
competitors
audio visual intimidating display
avid
key factor put hominid group altered state consciousness calls
battle trance
feel fear pain
religiously dedicated group interests
jordania suggests listening dancing sounds loud rhythmic rock music
contemporary combat units combat missions directly connected primordial evolutionary function music important psychological factor defense
defense predators
jordania suggested system core strategy obtain food confrontational
aggressive scavenging
jordania suggested singing behavior unevenly distributed animal species
living environments
ground
water
trees
singing species live trees
bird species
gibbons
live water
whales
dolphins
seals
sea lions
animal species live ground sing humans
suggested uneven distribution singing crucial understanding origins singing behavior animals humans
jordania explains fact result pressure natural selection
singing costly behavior
energy produce sounds
primarily security reasons
predators easily learn whereabouts singing animal
singing species live trees favourable situation
trees species live body weight
animals body weight live
levels
tree branches
tree living
arboreal
species feel secure sing communicate wide range vocal signals
hand
ground living
terrestrial
animal species
huge weight differences
ranging rabbits lions elephants
live
ground level
maintaining silence crucially important
birds
ardent singers
stop singing producing sounds sit ground
predator threat primary reason tree living species generally noisier ground living species
jordania suggested humming played important role early human
hominid
evolution contact calls
social animals produce seemingly haphazard indistinctive sounds
chicken cluck
everyday business
foraging
feeding
sounds functions
group members kin danger
case appearance signs danger
suspicious sounds
movements forest
animal notices danger
stops moving
stops producing sounds
remains silent direction danger sign
animals quickly follow suit group silent scanning environment danger
charles darwin notice phenomenon wild horses cattle
darwin
descent men
jordania suggested humans
social animals
silence sign danger
gentle humming musical sounds relax humans
gentle music music therapy
lullabies
book people sing
music human evolution jordania suggested prehistoric cannibalism function predator control
readily human corpses epidemics wars increase number man eating animals number predator attacks humans
practice cannibalism strategy deprive predators chances eat human flesh part diet
jordania
fatal attacks predators hominids humans
superb aggressive scavenging
hominids early humans attack predators groups fight back dead body killed member group
cannibalize body dead fellow member ritualistic manner
costly risky behavior
behavior eventually taught predators costly prey hominids humans
jordania suggested human evolutionary history reaching state
battle trance
specific state collective identity crucial physical survival hominids early humans
argued individual hominids weak slow survive predators
critical survival moments
predator attacks
combat situations
mortal danger children
humans enter altered state consciousness feel fear pain
question behavior members group
ready sacrifice lives evolutionary important goal
survival children group
jordania
human ability follow rhythm big groups
sing harmony
dance hours enter ecstatic state
tradition body painting
developed parts ritual practices order reach state collective identity
state collective identity group
keendisambiguation needed
survival overriding instincts individual survival
jordania suggested ability questions central cognitive element distinguishes human animal cognitive abilities
enculturated apes kanzi

sarah underwent extensive language training programs successfully learned answer complex questions requests failed learn questions
jordania suggested ability questions assessed relation comprehension syntactic structures
justified
questioning primarily cognitive ability
questions
asked young children syntactic structures
specific question intonation
pre syntactic
word stage language development
jordania suggested latin motto interrogo ergo cogito
questions
considers origin questioning behaviour human evolutionary history beginning human cognition language
jordania proposed asynchronous shift articulated speech populations resulted significant cross cultural differences speech reading related pathologies
stuttering dyslexia
acquisition phonological system young children
argued positive correlation presence strong traditions vocal polyphony
saharan africa regions europe
higher rate stuttering dyslexia
argues differences populations innate character
initiated studies understudied regions

jordania ideas considered controversial experts disciplines
