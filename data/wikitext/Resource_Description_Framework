family world wide web consortium
specifications originally designed metadata data model
general method conceptual description modeling information implemented web resources
variety syntax formats
rdf data model similar classic conceptual modeling approaches entity relationship class diagrams
based idea making statements resources

rdf abstract model serialization formats

resource triple encoded varies format format
mechanism describing resources major component semantic web activity
evolutionary stage world wide web automated software store
exchange
machine readable information distributed web
turn enabling users deal information greater efficiency certainty
rdf simple data model ability model disparate
abstract concepts led increasing knowledge management applications unrelated semantic web activity
collection rdf statements intrinsically represents labeled
directed multi graph
rdf based data model naturally suited kinds knowledge representation relational model ontological models
practice
rdf data persisted relational database native representations called triplestores
quad stores context

common serialization formats
xml format
format called simply rdf introduced specifications defining rdf
important distinguish xml format abstract rdf model

application
rdf xml
registered rfc
recommends rdf documents follow specifications
addition serializing rdf xml
introduced notation
xml serialization rdf models designed easier write hand
cases easier follow
based tabular notation
makes underlying triples encoded documents easily recognizable compared xml serialization
closely related turtle triples formats
triples stored triplestore
