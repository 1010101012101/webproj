walras francis ysidro edgeworth considered precursors modern mathematical economics
cournot
professor mathematics
developed mathematical treatment market condition defined competition sellers
treatment competition
published researches mathematical principles wealth
referred cournot duopoly
assumed sellers equal access market produce goods cost
assumed goods homogeneous
seller vary output based output market price determined total quantity supplied
profit firm determined multiplying output unit market price
differentiating profit function respect quantity supplied firm left system linear equations
simultaneous solution gave equilibrium quantity
price profits
cournot contributions mathematization economics neglected decades
eventually influenced marginalists

walras assumed equilibrium
money spent goods
good sold market price good buyer expend dollar basket goods
starting assumption
walras show markets markets cleared
reached equilibrium conditions
nth market clear
easiest visualize markets
considered texts market goods market money
markets reached equilibrium state
additional goods

french groping
meant serve practical expression walrasian general equilibrium
walras abstracted marketplace auction goods auctioneer call prices market participants wait satisfy personal reservation prices quantity desired
remembering auction goods
reservation price desired basket goods
buyers satisfied market price transactions occur
market
