chiptune
refer music made sound chips found early gaming systems microcomputers
waveform generator fundamental module sound synthesis system
waveform generator produces basic geometrical waveform fixed variable timbre variable pitch
common waveform generator configurations included simple waveforms single pseudo random noise generator
prng
waveforms included pulse wave
timbre varied modifying duty cycle
square wave
symmetrical pulse wave producing odd overtones
triangle wave
fixed timbre odd harmonics
softer square wave
sawtooth wave
bright raspy timbre odd harmonics
notable examples systems employing technology include game boy
