teachers singing
vocal pedagogy concepts part developing proper vocal technique
typical areas study include
singing proper vocal technique integrated coordinated act effectively coordinates physical processes singing
physical processes involved producing vocal sound
respiration
phonation
resonation
articulation
processes occur sequence
processes considered separately studied
actual practice merge coordinated function
effective singer speaker
rarely reminded process involved mind body coordinated perceives resulting unified function
vocal problems result lack coordination process
singing coordinated act
difficult discuss individual technical areas processes relating
phonation perspective connected respiration
articulators affect resonance
resonators affect vocal folds
vocal folds affect breath control
vocal problems result breakdown part coordinated process voice teachers frequently focus intensively area process student issue resolved
areas art singing result coordinated functions hard discuss traditional heading phonation

inevitably
students teachers concerned area technique
processes progress rates

areas vocal technique depend strongly student ability coordinate functions
singing skill requires highly developed muscle reflexes
singing require muscle strength require high degree muscle coordination
individuals develop voices careful systematic practice songs vocal exercises
vocal pedagogists instruct students exercise voices intelligent manner
singers thinking constantly kind sound making kind sensations feeling singing
vocal exercises purposes
including warming voice
extending vocal range
lining
voice horizontally vertically
acquiring vocal techniques legato
staccato
control dynamics
rapid figurations
learning sing wide intervals comfortably
singing trills
singing melismas correcting vocal faults
important goal vocal development learn sing natural limits vocal range obvious distracting quality technique
vocal pedagogists teach singer achieve goal physical processes involved singing
laryngeal action
breath support
resonance adjustment
articulatory movement

singing process functions physical conditions body exist
ability move air body freely obtain needed quantity air affected posture parts breathing mechanism
sunken chest position limit capacity lungs
tense abdominal wall inhibit downward travel diaphragm
good posture breathing mechanism fulfill basic function efficiently undue expenditure energy
good posture makes easier initiate phonation tune resonators proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension body
vocal pedagogists noted singers assume good posture greater sense assurance poise performing
audiences tend respond singers good posture
habitual good posture ultimately improves health body enabling blood circulation preventing fatigue stress body

scientific studies suggest singing positive effects people health
preliminary study based reported data survey students participating choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity
improved mood
stress reduction
perceived social spiritual benefits
