Sampler (musical instrument)

sampler
sampler
case playback
called sample player rompler
electronic musical instrument similar respects synthesizer
generating sounds
recordings
samples
sounds loaded recorded user played back means sampler program
keyboard
sequencer triggering device perform compose music
samples stored digital memory information quickly accessed
single sample pitch shifted produce musical scales chords
samplers offer filters
modulation low frequency oscillation synthesizer processes original sound modified ways
samplers polyphonic capabilities play note time
multitimbral play back sounds time
prior computer memory based samplers
musicians tape replay keyboards
store recordings analog tape
key pressed tape head contacts tape plays sound
mellotron notable model
number groups late
systems expensive heavy due multiple tape mechanisms involved
range instrument limited octaves
change sounds set tapes installed instrument

percussion sampler progressed hip hop drum machine sound release august
ushering sample based sound late early
akai pioneered processing techniques
crossfade looping
time stretch
shorten lengthen samples affecting pitch vice versa
hybrid synthesizers began utilize short samples
attack phase instrument

samplers
traditional foley artists
mainstay modern sound effects production
digital techniques effects pitch shifted altered ways required hours tape
sampler controlled attached music keyboard external midi source
note message received sampler accesses sample
multiple samples arranged keyboard
assigned note group notes
keyboard tracking samples shifted pitch amount
group notes single sample assigned called keyzone
resultant set zones called keymap

general samplers play back kind recorded audio samplers offer editing facilities user modify process audio apply wide range effects
making sampler powerful versatile musical tool
sampler organized hierarchy progressively complicated data structures
bottom lie samples
individual recordings sound

reference center pitch actual frequency recorded note
samples
looped
defining points repeated section sample starts ends
allowing short sample play endlessly
cases
loop crossfade
allowing obvious transitions loop point fading end loop fading beginning
keymaps arranged instruments
level parameters added define keymaps played
filters applied change sound color low frequency oscillators envelope generators shape amplitude
pitch
filter parameters sound
instruments multiple layers keymaps order play sample time keymap set parameters incoming noe events affect layer differently
layers sensitivity velocity incoming note
altering resulting timbre hard note played
level
basic approaches sampler organization
bank approach
instrument assigned midi channel multiple banks stored reconfigure sampler
powerful approach associate instrument patch number midi channel configured separately sending controller information individual channel
samplers work
keymapping system
spread
sample range keys
side effects desirable contexts
speeding slowing drum loops
higher lower parts keymap sound unnatural
arranging pitched instrument keymaps
transition noticeable realistic imitation instrument art make transitions smooth
