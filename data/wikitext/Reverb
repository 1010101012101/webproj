Reverberation

reverberation
reverberation persistence sound space original sound produced
reverberation
reverb
created sound produced enclosed space causing large number echoes build slowly decay sound absorbed walls air
noticeable sound source stops reflections continue
decreasing amplitude
longer heard
length sound decay
reverberation time
receives special consideration architectural design large chambers
specific reverberation times achieve optimum performance intended activity
comparison distinct echo initial sound
reverberation thousands echoes arrive quick succession
