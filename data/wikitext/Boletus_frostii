boletus frostii mycorrhizal species
meaning fungus forms associations roots species trees
associations mutualistic
fungus absorbs mineral nutrients soil channels plant
plant fungus sugars
product photosynthesis
characteristic feature mycorrhiza presence sheath fungal tissue encases terminal
nutrient absorbing rootlets host plant
fungus forms extensive underground network hyphae radiate outward surface root sheath
effectively increasing surface area nutrient absorption
hyphae invade root cortical cells form hartig net
