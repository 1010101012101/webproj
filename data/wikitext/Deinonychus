bite force estimates deinonychus produced

study concluded deinonychus maximum bite force modern american alligator
study paul gignac colleagues attempted estimate bite force based directly newly discovered deinonychus tooth puncture marks bones tenontosaurus
puncture marks large individual
provided evidence large deinonychus bite bone
tooth marks
gignac team determine bite force deinonychus significantly higher earlier studies estimated biomechanical studies
found bite force deinonychus newtons
greater living carnivorous mammals including hyena
equivalent similarly sized alligator
gignac colleagues noted
bone puncture marks deinonychus rare
unlike larger theropods puncture marks tyrannosaurus
deinonychus frequently bite eat bone
high bite force defense prey capture

distinctive feature deinonychus
shape curvature sickle claw varies specimens

similar profile normal claws remaining toes
ostrom suggested difference size shape sickle claws due individual
sexual
age related variation
admitted
anatomical trackway evidence talon held ground dinosaur walked fourth toes
ostrom suggested deinonychus kick sickle claw cut slash prey
researchers suggested talon disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs
studies suggested sickle claws slash deliver small stabs victim
manning

deinonychus ratio
ostrom stated
reasonable conclusion
deinonychus fast compared dinosaurs
fast modern flightless birds
low foot lower leg ratio deinonychus due partly unusually short metatarsus
upper foot bones
ratio larger smaller individuals larger
ostrom suggested short metatarsus related function sickle claw
fact appears shorter individuals aged support
interpreted short toe enlarged claw

ostrom suggested short metatarsus reduced stress leg bones attack
interpreted unusual arrangement muscle attachments deinonychus leg support idea set muscles predatory stroke walking running
ostrom concluded legs deinonychus represented balance running adaptations needed agile predator
stress reducing features compensate unique foot weapon
