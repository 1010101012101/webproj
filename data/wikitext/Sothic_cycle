sothic cycle
day year loses time start year coincides heliacal rising star sirius
latinized greek
star called sopdet egyptians
greek transcribed sothis
single year heliacal risings sothis sothic year
rising occurred month beginning nile flood
matter primary importance agricultural society

mislocating observation potentially change resulting chronology decades

sothic cycle specific cycles differing length interacting cycle
called tertiary cycle
mathematically defined formula
half harmonic
case sothic cycle cycles egyptian calendar year
sothic
year
tertiary cycles occur turn signals cars
pumps filling swimming pool
hands analog clock passing
time required faster car lap ahead slower car traveling race track
sothic year length time star sirius
sothis visually return position relation sun
star years measured vary due precession
movement earth axis relation sun
length time star make yearly path marked rises defined altitude local horizon time sunrise
altitude altitude visibility
year star rise approximately minutes earlier successive sunrise
eventually star return relative location sunrise
length time called observational year
stars reside close ecliptic ecliptic meridian average exhibit observational years close sidereal year
ecliptic meridian cut sky quadrants
axis earth wobbles slowly moving observer changing observation event
axis swings observer closer event observational year shortened
likewise
observational year lengthened axis swings observer
depends quadrant sky phenomenon observed
sothic year remarkable average duration

slow rate change note
observations records maintained predynastic times sothic rise optimally return calendar day calendar years

noticed
sothic cycle confirms
sirius move retrograde sky stars
phenomenon widely precession equinox
prof
jed buchwald pointed
sirius remains distance equinoxes solstices centuries
precession
reason
helical rising
zenith
sirius slip calendar
precession rate day
years
stars
remarkable stability solar year reason egyptians basis calendar star sufficed
lunisolar theory precession requires earth wobble lose complete rotation axis revolution sun
relative fixed stars
precession cycle
modern astronomers measure rate precession radio telescopes fixed distant quasars process long baseline interferometry
vlbi
confirms earth orientation stars
arc seconds
equating complete precession equinox years
nonetheless
sirius
due proper motion
remains practically stationary making ideal marker ancient egyptian planning purposes
determining date heliacal rise sothis shown difficult
exact latitude observation
problem egyptian calendar loses day years
heliacal rise place day years row
observation rise date years
making observation extremely precise
number criticisms leveled reliability dating sothic cycle
considered problematic
astronomical observations dates mention specific pharaoh reign observed
forcing egyptologists supply information basis amount informed speculation
information nature civil calendar egyptian history
forcing egyptologists assume existed unchanged thousands years
criticisms considered problematic
extant mention sothic cycle ancient egyptian writing
simply result obvious egyptians merit mention relevant texts destroyed time awaiting discovery
