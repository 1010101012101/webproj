Stratigraphy (archaeology)

stratigraphy
stratigraphy key concept modern archaeological theory practice
modern excavation techniques based stratigraphic principles
concept derives geological idea sedimentation takes place uniform principles
archaeological finds surface ground
commonly case
identification context find vital enabling archaeologist draw conclusions site nature date occupation
archaeologist role attempt discover contexts exist created
archaeological stratification sequence dynamic superimposition single units stratigraphy

principle original horizontality states archaeological layer deposited unconsolidated form tend horizontal deposition
strata found tilted surfaces originally deposited
lie conformity contours pre existing basin deposition
principle lateral continuity states archaeological deposit
originally laid
bounded edge basin deposition
thin feather edge
edge deposit exposed vertical plane view
part original extent removed excavation erosion
continuity sought
absence explained
principle stratigraphic succession states unit archaeological stratification takes place stratigraphic sequence site position undermost units lie uppermost units lie physical contact
superpositional relationships regarded redundant
