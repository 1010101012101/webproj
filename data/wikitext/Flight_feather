Flight feather

flight feather
flight feathers long
stiff
asymmetrically shaped
symmetrically paired feathers wings tail bird
wings called remiges
singular remex
tail called rectrices
singular rectrix
primary function aid generation thrust lift
enabling flight
flight feathers birds evolved perform additional functions
generally territorial displays
courtship rituals feeding methods
species
feathers developed long showy plumes visual courtship displays
create sound display flights
tiny serrations leading edge remiges owls fly silently
hunt successfully
extra stiff rectrices woodpeckers brace tree trunks hammer
flightless birds retain flight feathers

longest narrowest remiges
attached phalanges
individually rotated
feathers important flapping flight
principal source thrust
moving bird forward air
thrust generated downstroke flapping flight
upstroke
bird draws wing close body
primaries separated rotated
reducing air resistance helping provide thrust
flexibility remiges wingtips large soaring birds spreading feathers
helps reduce creation wingtip vortices
reducing drag
barbules feathers
friction barbules
specialized large lobular barbicels grip prevent slippage overlying feathers present flying birds
species vary number primaries possess

missing distal primary
called remicle
typically small rudimentary passerines
