modern biology recent development

origins modern biology approach study nature traced back ancient greece
formal study medicine dates back hippocrates
aristotle
contributed extensively development biology
important history animals works showed naturalist leanings
empirical works focused biological causation diversity life
aristotle successor lyceum
theophrastus
wrote series books botany survived important contribution antiquity plant sciences
middle ages
scholars medieval islamic world wrote biology included jahiz
dinawari
wrote botany
rhazes
wrote anatomy physiology
medicine studied islamic scholars working greek philosopher traditions
natural history drew heavily aristotelian thought
upholding fixed hierarchy life
biology began quickly develop grow antony van leeuwenhoek improvement microscope
scholars discovered spermatozoa
bacteria
infusoria diversity microscopic life
investigations jan swammerdam led interest entomology built basic techniques microscopic dissection staining

early century
number biologists pointed central importance cell
schleiden schwann began promoting ideas
basic unit organisms cell
individual cells characteristics life
opposed idea
cells division cells
work robert remak rudolf virchow
biologists accepted tenets cell theory
taxonomy classification focus natural historians
carolus linnaeus published basic taxonomy natural world
variations
introduced scientific names species
georges louis leclerc
comte buffon
treated species artificial categories living forms suggesting possibility common descent
opposed evolution
buffon key figure history evolutionary thought
work influenced evolutionary theories lamarck darwin
evolutionary thinking originated works jean baptiste lamarck
british naturalist charles darwin
combining biogeographical approach humboldt
uniformitarian geology lyell
malthus writings population growth
morphological expertise
created successful evolutionary theory based natural selection
similar reasoning evidence led alfred russel wallace independently reach conclusions
discovery physical representation heredity evolutionary principles population genetics
early
experiments pointed dna component chromosomes held genes
focus model organisms viruses bacteria
discovery double helical structure dna
marked transition era molecular genetics
present times
biology vastly extended molecular domain
genetic code cracked har gobind khorana
robert
holley marshall warren nirenberg dna understood codons
finally
human genome project launched goal mapping general human genome
project essentially completed
analysis published
human genome project step globalized effort incorporate accumulated knowledge biology functional
molecular definition human body bodies organisms
modern biology encompassed unifying principles
cell theory
evolution
genetics
homeostasis
energy
cell theory states cell fundamental unit life
living things composed cells secreted products cells
shells
cells arise cells cell division
multicellular organisms
cell organism body derives ultimately single cell fertilized egg
cell considered basic unit pathological processes
additionally
phenomenon energy flow occurs cells processes part function metabolism
finally
cells hereditary information
dna
passed cell cell cell division
central organizing concept biology life develops evolution
life forms common origin
introduced scientific lexicon jean baptiste lamarck
evolution established charles darwin fifty years viable scientific model articulated driving force
natural selection
alfred russel wallace recognized discoverer concept helped research experiment concept evolution
evolution explain great variations life found earth
darwin theorized species breeds developed processes natural selection artificial selection selective breeding
genetic drift embraced additional mechanism evolutionary development modern synthesis theory
evolutionary history describes characteristics species genealogical relationship species phylogeny
widely varied approaches biology generate information phylogeny
include comparisons dna sequences conducted molecular biology genomics
