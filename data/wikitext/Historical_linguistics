historical linguistics
called diachronic linguistics
study language change
main concerns
modern historical linguistics dates late century
grew earlier discipline philology
study ancient texts documents dating back antiquity
historical linguistics comparative linguistics
scholars concerned chiefly establishing language families reconstructing prehistoric proto languages
comparative method internal reconstruction
focus initially indo european languages
long written histories
scholars studied uralic languages
european language family early written material exists
significant comparative linguistic work expanding european languages
austronesian languages families native american languages

comparative linguistics
originally comparative philology
branch historical linguistics concerned comparing languages order establish historical relatedness
languages related convergence borrowing genetic descent
languages change cross relate
genetic relatedness implies common origin proto language
comparative linguistics goal constructing language families
reconstructing proto languages
resulted documented languages
maintain clear distinction attested language reconstructed forms
comparative linguists prefix asterisk form found surviving texts
etymology study history words entered language
source
form meaning changed time
word enter language loanword
word language adopted speakers language
derivational morphology combining pre existing elements language
hybrid processes called phono semantic matching
minor ways
languages long detailed history
etymology makes philology
study words change culture culture time
etymologists apply methods comparative linguistics reconstruct information languages direct information
writing
analyzing related languages technique comparative method
linguists make inferences
shared parent language vocabulary
word roots traced back origin
instance
indo european language family found
originating philological tradition
current etymological research language families early documentation
uralic austronesian
dialectology scientific study linguistic dialect
varieties language characteristic groups
based primarily geographic distribution features
contrast variations based social factors
studied sociolinguistics
variations based time
studied historical linguistics
dialectology treats topics divergence local dialects common ancestor synchronic variation
dialectologists concerned grammatical features correspond regional areas
dealing populations living specific locales generations moving
immigrant groups bringing languages settlements
phonology field linguistics studies sound system specific language set languages
phonetics physical production perception sounds speech
phonology describes sounds function language languages
