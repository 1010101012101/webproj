chronostratigraphy
chronostratigraphy branch stratigraphy studies age rock strata relation time

chronostratigraphy relies heavily isotope geology geochronology derive hard dating defined rock units specific fossil assemblages defined stratigraphic system
practically difficult isotopically date fossils sedimentary rocks directly
inferences made order arrive age date reflects beginning interval
methodology derived law superposition principles cross cutting relationships
igneous rocks occur specific intervals time essentially instantaneous geologic time scale
mineral assemblages dated accurately precisely isotopic methods
construction chronostratigraphic column relies heavily intrusive extrusive igneous rocks
metamorphism
faulting
bracket depositional intervals chronostratigraphic column
metamorphic rocks occasionally dated
give limits age bed laid
bed graptolites overlies crystalline basement point
dating crystalline basement give maximum age fossil assemblage
process requires considerable degree effort checking field relationships age dates
instance
millions years bed laid intrusive rock cutting
estimate age necessarily oldest cross cutting intrusive rock fossil assemblage youngest rock fossil assemblage rests
