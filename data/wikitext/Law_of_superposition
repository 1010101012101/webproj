law superposition
principle superposition
key axiom based observations natural history foundational principle sedimentary stratigraphy geology dependent natural sciences
law formulated century danish scientist nicolas steno
discussing origins mountains book healing
avicenna outlined principle superposition strata
assuming rocks minerals fluid
nicolas steno reasoned rock strata formed particles fluid water fell bottom
process leave horizontal layers
steno principle original horizontality states rock layers form horizontal position
deviations horizontal position due rocks disturbed
exceptions case
sediments deposited slopes gradients
steep
locally
degrees
principle essentially true
steno stated
general principle
words
solid object solids form conform shape
steno show reasoning fossils crystals solidified host rock formed
tongue stone
grown rock
distorted surrounding rock
tree root distorted growing crack earth

formed surrounding rock solid
show irregularities form caused conform surrounding solid rock
finally
case strata
layers top set strata conform shape lower layers
set strata youngest layers top layer
oldest lie bottom
youngest layer deposited oldest layers
determines place layers
oldest deposited bottom vice versa
steno observation rock strata form particles fall suspension fluid
youngest stratum top sequence
principle applies types rocks form water
volcanic rocks spread older flows
flow banding
steno realized geological processes create apparent exceptions laws superposition horizontality
reasoned formation caves remove part lower layer
collapse cave transport large pieces upper layer
recognized rocks uplifted subterranean forces
geologists recognize tilting
folding
faulting complicate analysis stratigraphic sequence
molten rock force surrounding rocks squeeze older rock layers
forming exception steno law
anomalies leave physical evidence disturbed rocks
faulted rock layers cracked
broken
metamorphosed fault lines
steno law statement relative time
absolute time
rock layers
principle
form millions years
days
steno difficulty attributing formation rocks flood mentioned bible
noticed
major rock types apennine mountains florence
italy
lower layers fossils
upper rich fossils
suggested upper layers formed flood
creation life
lower formed life existed
geology distinguish time periods earth history approach develop spectacularly work scientists
thrust faults unknown steno contemporaries late century early century peach horne knockan crag

moine thrust fault
thrust faults confusion law superposition occur parallel bedding difficult detect
creating situations inexplicably
older strata overlay younger
combined related principle faunal succession
law superposition powerful tool dating rocks strata
superposition archaeology stratification excavation slightly processes involved laying archaeological strata geological processes
man made intrusions activity archaeological record form chronologically top bottom deformed horizontal natural strata equivalent processes
archaeological strata
termed contexts layers
created undercutting previous strata
silt backfill underground drain form time ground immediately
examples vertical superposition modifications standing structures creation doors windows wall
