algebraic topology
algebraic topology branch mathematics tools abstract algebra study topological spaces
basic goal find algebraic invariants classify topological spaces homeomorphism
classify homotopy equivalence
algebraic topology primarily algebra study topological problems
topology solve algebraic problems
algebraic topology
convenient proof subgroup free group free group
older subject combinatorial topology
implying emphasis space constructed simpler onescitation needed
modern standard tool construction complex
basic method applied algebraic topology investigate spaces algebraic invariants mapping spaces
groups great deal manageable structure respects relation homeomorphism
general homotopy

extended
eilenberg steenrod generalized approach
defined homology cohomology functors equipped natural transformations subject axioms
weak equivalence spaces passes isomorphism homology groups
verified existing
homology theories satisfied axioms
proved axiomatization uniquely characterized theory
approach functor filtered spaces crossed complexes defined directly homotopically relative homotopy groups
higher homotopy van kampen theorem proved functor enables basic results algebraic topology
border homology homotopy
obtained singular homology simplicial approximation
approach called nonabelian algebraic topology
generalises higher dimensions ideas coming fundamental group
