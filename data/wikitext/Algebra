founded discipline jabr
deserves title
support diophantus point fact algebra found jabr slightly elementary algebra found arithmetica arithmetica syncopated jabr fully rhetorical
support khwarizmi point fact introduced methods
reduction
balancing
transposition subtracted terms side equation
cancellation terms opposite sides equation
term jabr originally referred
gave exhaustive explanation solving quadratic equations
supported geometric proofs
treating algebra independent discipline
algebra longer concerned
series problems resolved
exposition starts primitive terms combinations give prototypes equations
henceforward explicitly constitute true object study
studied equation sake
generic manner
simply emerge solving problem
specifically called define infinite class problems
