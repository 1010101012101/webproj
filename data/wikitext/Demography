stable population necessarily remain fixed size
expanding shrinking
note crude death rate defined applied population give misleading impression
number deaths people higher developed nations developed countries
standards health developed countries
developed countries proportionally older people
die year
mortality rate higher mortality rate age lower
complete picture mortality life table summarises mortality separately age
life table give good estimate life expectancy
fertility rates give misleading impression population growing faster fact
measurement fertility rates involves reproductive rate women
